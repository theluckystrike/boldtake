We have filmed in The Chateaux Impney a French fantasy in Droitwich, the little theatre in Chipping Norton (an ex Salvation Army Citadel), the wonderful 18th Century octagonal Crown Courts in Warwick and an atmospheric ex-Nunnery in Great Malvern with a glorious chapel by Ninian Comper.\"Also, The Fleece Inn in Bretforton which is a English pub time capsule, the spectacular Baroque church at Great Witley, and to top it off a selection of lovely stone Cotswold houses and churches.

        "content": "BUDAPEST, August 8. /TASS/. The leadership of the European Union is using the same disinformation methods against the Hungarian government that the Democratic administration of the United States used against Republican Donald Trump, accusing him of collusion with Russia during the presidential election in 2016, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said, commenting on the investigation launched by the US Department of Justice on the Kossuth radio program. \"This is a real political bombshell,\" he said regarding the conclusions of the US authorities that the charges against Trump were fabricated by the Barack Obama administration. According to him, the move was meant to smear the Republican candidate and justify Democratic rival Hillary Clinton’s loss in the election. Orban emphasized that this happened with the participation of the federal authorities and \"using government institutions.\" More recently, the Democratic administration of the United States and George Soros’s foundation used the same methods against the Hungarian government, using \"paid media.\" \"Now Brussels is taking a page out of their book,\" the prime minister said. He had previously stated that the EU leadership was trying to discredit the Hungarian government with the aim of installing a political opposition in the country that would be obedient to Brussels. In 2016, US secret services accused Russia of interfering in the US election, and the media published unconfirmed accusations of collusion between Trump and Moscow. In the United States, an investigation was conducted under the leadership of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, which ended in April 2019, finding no evidence of collusion between Trump and Russia. After Trump returned to the White House in 2025, new information emerged about the falsification of data on the basis of which charges were brought against him. In early July, the New York Post mentioned a CIA report that pointed to irregularities and political motivation in the case. US Attorney General Pam Bondi ordered a new investigation, and Trump said the false charges against him were the \"crime of the century.\" On August 1, he announced on Truth Social that the charges had been refuted. The president urged punishment for those responsible.",

Speaking from Budapest, Orban suggested that similar strategies aimed at undermining his government's credibility could also be seen within the EU context, drawing parallels to past U.S. investigations into President Trump's ties with Russia.",
        "ai_content": "In a striking comparison, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has equated the European Union's purported efforts to undermine his government through disinformation campaigns to the infamous Trump-Russia collusion allegations. During a broadcast on Kossuth radio, Orban criticized what he perceives as a concerted attempt by EU leaders to install a pro-Brussels political opposition in Hungary. 'This is a real political bombshell,' Orban remarked after learning of the US Department of Justice's findings suggesting that previous charges against former President Donald Trump may have been politically motivated fabrications by the Obama administration. Orban drew attention to the use of paid media and governmental resources in these endeavors, noting that such tactics now appear to be replicated by Brussels. His comments come amid ongoing discussions about the integrity of democratic processes influenced by foreign interference narratives. In 2016, Russian involvement in the US election led to widespread speculation and subsequent legal scrutiny spearheaded by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, culminating in a lack of conclusive evidence linking Trump to Russian entities. However, revelations later surfaced questioning the veracity of some key pieces of evidence presented during the investigation.",

        "content": "Yukon is gearing up for a territorial election later this year and this time around, the voting system itself is on the ballot. This year’s election will feature a plebiscite on whether the territory should continue to elect leaders through first-past-the-post (FPTP), the system currently in use across Canada, or to adopt a different set of rules. “This non-binding vote does not result in an immediate change but helps to gauge what Yukoners think about potentially changing the voting system,” reads a release from the territory published Thursday. “The Government of Yukon will continue to remain neutral during this process.” The move comes following a yearslong committee review of the territory’s voting system. In its final report last fall, the Yukon Citizens’ Assembly on Electoral Reform recommended replacing FPTP with a ranked vote system, wherein voters choose multiple candidates in order of who they would most prefer to win, and those second, third and other choices are factored in. Under the current FPTP system, the candidate in each race with the largest number of votes wins, regardless of whether they secure a majority. Meanwhile, in a ranked-voting election, if no candidate wins a majority, then the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated from the running and their votes are redistributed based on who each voter chose as their second choice. This process repeats until a candidate passes the majority threshold, and a winner is declared. FPTP remains in use for the vast majority of Canadian elections, but ranked-ballot systems do commonly appear in leadership races for political parties, and occasionally in municipal votes. In 2018, the City of London, Ont., held a mayoral race by ranked-choice vote, but two years later, the province outlawed ranked ballots in future municipal elections.",

The government has remained neutral while reviewing recommendations from the Citizens' Assembly that suggest adopting ranked voting, which could impact how winners are determined in close races.",
        "ai_content": "In preparation for the forthcoming territorial election, Yukon Territory officials have announced a plebiscite concerning the adoption of a new voting system. Voters will soon face a decision regarding the continuation of the existing first-past-the-post (FPTP) electoral method used throughout Canada versus transitioning to a ranked-ballot system. The proposed shift aims to address concerns raised after extensive deliberation by the Yukon Citizens’ Assembly on Electoral Reform, whose final report suggested moving away from FPTP due to potential issues such as unrepresentative outcomes when no single candidate achieves a majority.\nUnder the current FPTP framework, only the highest vote-getter in each constituency secures victory, irrespective of achieving more than half of the total votes cast. Conversely, the ranked-voting model allows citizens to rank candidates according to preference, ensuring that even minority-supported candidates contribute to determining the ultimate victor once subsequent preferences are considered.\nThe plebiscite represents a preliminary step towards gauging public opinion rather than enacting immediate changes; however, it underscores the government's commitment to exploring alternative democratic processes within the region. As part of this initiative, Yukon residents will weigh in on whether altering the voting mechanism aligns with their vision for fairer representation and governance.\nWhile FPTP dominates Canadian federal elections, ranked ballots find occasional application at party leader selection events and some local elections—such as London's mayoral contest in Ontario—which was conducted using this system in 2018. However, legislative action taken subsequently prohibited further utilization of ranked ballots in municipal contexts there.\nAs Yukon approaches this pivotal moment in its electoral history, stakeholders await insights into the community's stance on reforming one of Canada's foundational political practices.",

        "description": "One of the worse feelings in this current state of affairs, is the casual dismissal by allies and those considered like minded folks of issues they think do not concern them. It’s having them insist on telling you why you are wrong about the issues you live with every day, while asking you to rally around the causes that matter to them. The realization that a lot of people on our side do not in reality care about righting wrongs that don’t affect them, about restoring rights they already enjoy, it is the slow dawning comprehension that for all intents and purposes a lot of our allies will not stand by us, unless there’s something in it for them. I confess, personally it makes me feel depressed at times, but frustration is my constant companion. If I can’t convince folks on my side that my issues matter, how the hell will I ever convince the other side? How will they ever change? Grow? When allies tell you “you are preaching to the choir” do they realize they have just said they have “black fatigue”? They are tired of hearing about our issues? Telling us that the Jeans/Gene commercial was “just a play on words” is akin to telling us “stop exaggerating” “not everything is about race”? I don’t think they realize the import nor the underlying meaning of their words. Imagine getting in an multi car accident, going to the hospital and all the doctors keep examining the scratches on the hands and faces of victims one after the other as you lay there telling them your leg with the bone sticking out hurts, and have them tell you, yes we see your leg, we can see its broken, we know it hurts, but it’s easier to get these lesser hurt people out first, then we’ll get to you. That’s how I feel at times trying to get through to some people. Since tacoman came on the political scene there have been over 1000 bills and laws, proposed and passed, that have rescinded minority rights, whitewashed history, data, archives, practices etc... everything from Affirmative Action to Rosa Part has been diluted or remove. Not one single bill passed in that same period by the first or second taco administration has uplifted the economy (quite the contrary), but allies still tell us “it’s is about the economy stupid” it’s abot “working class issues” as they try and justify why the not maga voted for taco. We’ve had don’t say gay bills, anti-trans bills, don’t make our children uncomfortable bills, eliminate abortion bills, ban books bills, erase DEI bills, cancel AA bills, deportation bills, but they still look us straight in the eye and say ‘it’s the economy stupid”. How? Taco talked more about Trans folks, immigrants, Black folks, abortion than he ever did about the economy, on the other hand Harris talked more about economic solutions than cultural issues... yet the narrative is inverted when talk of the election rises up. And for the love of God, don’t go on about low information and they didn’t know or whatever other excuse pops up. The slide towards fascism in red states, the narratives from the right, the bills and laws were in full swing and view since the first round of taco. People were knocking on doors informing voters more than ever before. It is part of that careless dismissal. You want it to be something else so much you can taste it. Anything but that! But it is that. It was that. It will always be that, until corrected. So, I’m sitting here wondering today how is this possible? Are left-learning people just as susceptible to manipulation and propaganda as the right? Are they just as unconcerned by minority issues? Are our allies, those like minded folks really that blind? Do they not see the sheer magnitude of events, actions, bills, laws being enacted against minorities? I know they do, because they comment about them individually for the most part. But it’s like they refuse to face the totality of what’s going on, preferring to pick and choose instances so they don’t have to reckon with reality. The disconnect is baffling, for they talk about white supremacy, they talk about Christian nationalism, they talk about authoritarian state, but when you bring up that the jeans/gene commercial is about race, they say no no no, you’re seeing things that aren’t there. If the issue isn’t race, how is the result white supremacy? Riddle me that one Batman.How do we solve a problem that people refuse to acknowledge? Talk about it, we get backlash, don’t talk about it, makes them happy but it’s swept under the rug and quickly forgotten until the next outrage. So what is a Black US Citizen to do in this climate of persistent denial? One day they are all on your side, yes yes, it’s racism, white supremacy, then an event happens and you say “that’s white supremacy” and they go “No it’s not, it’s just a joke, a play on words” and I’m left scratching my head in utmost confusion.It's the same thing with the “why don’t dems do something” crowd. Every other day I have headlines emblazoned across my recommendations “finally dems are doing something!” then 2 days later again “finally Dems are doing something!” and a 1 or 2 after that “Dems are on the attack!” or some such... do they know what “finally” means? And still in between those headlines, they keep attacking dems. Well the dems they don’t like. Because let’s be real, I’ve yet to see a headline or article asking “why don’t progressives (or independents) do something!”. Personally, I see lots of Dems, Progressives and Independents doing things according to their strength and I’m fine with the fact that their names are not everyday on display. I don’t know folks, as I watch this country rip itself apart from all directions, I can’t help but think about how broken we all seem to be. Most folks don’t seem to care about anything beyond their doorstep, and it is the saddest sight ever. Does it even register that close to 13% of US Citizens, have for all intents and purposes quit? That they’ve been let down so many times they’ve finally stopped trusting you? Stopped believing and most sadly we have stopped hoping? “Someone sent me enough to take care of this month urgencies! Thank you! If others want to help out paypal.me/murielvieux there are always folks needing help and if I can get ahead of next month so much better, but this month is covered so no pressure.

The disconnect is baffling, for they talk about white supremacy, they talk about Christian nationalism, they talk about authoritarian state, but when you bring up that the jeans/gene commercial is about race, they say no no no, you’re seeing things that aren’t there. If the issue isn’t race, how is the result white supremacy ? Riddle me that one Batman. How do we solve a problem that people refuse to acknowledge? Talk about it, we get backlash, don’t talk about it, makes them happy but it’s swept under the rug and quickly forgotten until the next outrage. So what is a Black US Citizen to do in this climate of persistent denial? One day they are all on your side, yes yes, it’s racism, white supremacy, then an event happens and you say “that’s white supremacy” and they go “No it’s not, it’s just a joke, a play on words” and I’m left scratching my head in utmost confusion. It's the same thing with the “why don’t dems do something” crowd. Every other day I have headlines emblazoned across my recommendations “finally dems are doing something!” then 2 days later again “finally Dems are doing something!” and a 1 or 2 after that “Dems are on the attack!” or some such... do they know what “finally” means? And still in between those headlines, they keep attacking dems. Well the dems they don’t like. Because let’s be real, I’ve yet to see a headline or article asking “why don’t progressives (or independents) do something!”. Personally, I see lots of Dems, Progressives and Independents doing things according to their strength and I’m fine with the fact that their names are not everyday on display. I don’t know folks, as I watch this country rip itself apart from all directions, I can’t help but think about how broken we all seem to be. Most folks don’t seem to care about anything beyond their doorstep, and it is the saddest sight ever. Does it even register that close to 13% of US Citizens, have for all intents and purposes quit? That they’ve been let down so many times they’ve finally stopped trusting you? Stopped believing and most sadly we have stopped hoping? “Someone sent me enough to take care of this month urgencies! Thank you! If others want to help out paypal.me/murielvieux there are always folks needing help and if I can get ahead of next month so much better, but this month is covered so no pressure. I’m not pretending I’m saving the world or even Haiti but I’m helping to keep some folks fed, I choose families with kids as priorities, and that’s good enough for me.“ #TheAmericanHaitianPoet #Woke #SocialPoetry Paypal.me/murielvieux (small donations go a long way in Haiti) Muriel Vieux – August 8 th , 2025 – ©All rights reserved",

        "ai_summary": "The author expresses disappointment with allies who dismiss issues important to marginalized communities, feeling ignored when advocating for civil rights. Despite numerous legislative efforts aimed at undermining minority protections during the Trump administration, many allies continue to prioritize economic arguments rather than supporting social justice initiatives.",
        "ai_content": "In recent years, individuals within marginalized groups have felt increasingly alienated by what appears to be a lack of genuine support from supposed allies. This sense of betrayal stems from witnessing others trivialize concerns central to their daily lives—concerns such as racial discrimination, gender inequality, and LGBTQ+ rights. Allies often seem more interested in discussing topics unrelated to these pressing matters, leaving advocates frustrated and questioning where true solidarity lies.\nThis disillusionment became particularly acute following the election of Donald Trump, whose tenure saw over 1000 pieces of legislation introduced or enacted that sought to erode minority rights across various domains—from affirmative action policies to historical recognition. These actions included attempts to dilute or outright repeal measures designed to protect against systemic racism and promote equality.\nDespite these significant setbacks, proponents of progressive values continued to argue that broader socioeconomic issues were paramount. However, activists found little solace in these reassurances; instead, they perceived a disconnect between ally rhetoric and tangible support for movements fighting against oppression.\nThe situation mirrors a scenario where multiple vehicles collide, yet medical attention focuses solely on minor injuries before addressing life-threatening conditions—a metaphor illustrating the neglect experienced by those suffering under oppressive systems. As advocacy continues amidst ongoing challenges, the struggle for understanding and meaningful alliance remains fraught with obstacles.",

The man was referring to the British-American commentator’s appearance on Surrounded , a gladiatorial one-v-many debate web series, hosted on YouTube by Jubilee Media. During the debate – billed as “ 1 Progressive vs 20 Far-Right Conservatives ” – Hasan was asked about his “ethnic background”, by a man who the Guardian unmasked as the organiser of two violent far-right protests . Another debater laughed maniacally to applause while agreeing he was a fascist (he was later sacked, condemned – and then raised $30,000 (£22,300) from supporters on a Christian crowdfunding site). The video has now been viewed more than 10m times. “I saw the massive audience it gets with young people. I thought, well, that’s a good place to be,” says Hasan , who launched Zeteo, his own alternative news platform, last year. “But it’s really cut through in a way even I didn’t imagine – it’s been phenomenal for both good reasons and bad.” Hasan’s near two-hour debate – diced, sliced and repackaged for infinite resharing – has propelled Jubilee Media into the mainstream consciousness, sparking conversations about the political and societal impact of new media formats, and plenty of existential angst. Launched in 2017, the rapidly expanding entertainment company has attracted swathes of younger viewers by transforming polarised debate – never in short supply in Trump’s US – into eminently clippable content. The company also produces dating and game shows, but Surrounded – which pits one expert against a greater number of adversaries, who race to a single chair to make their point on a hot political topic – is its most notorious. In recent months Surrounded has gone where few traditional broadcasters would care to tread, with titles including “Flat Earthers vs Scientists: Can We Trust Science?” (31m views), or “Can 25 Liberal College Students Outsmart 1 Conservative? (Feat. Charlie Kirk)” (30m views). Its 2024 video with Ben Shapiro – in which a trans man tore into the rightwing pundit in a four-minute rant – was the fifth most-watched election-related content on YouTube. Its founder and chief executive, Jason Y Lee, who started Jubilee as a non-profit in 2010 after a video of him busking for charity went viral , told Variety that the company wants “to show what discourse can and should look like”. It could become, he argued, the “Disney for empathy”. But how does its performative pugilism sit with its stated aim to “provoke understanding and create human connection”? Spencer Kornhaber, who writes about popular culture for the Atlantic, believes the idealism is genuine, if shot through with ambition. “Empathy, in the Jubilee context, is standing for voyeurism and curiosity about other human beings,” says Kornhaber. “Lee didn’t say he wants to be the new UN. He wants to be Disney – a for-profit entertainment company that is culturally ubiquitous, will merchandise anything and is known for its ability to spin out franchises.” Jubilee has benefited from the proliferation of free-speech absolutism, as well as the internet’s shift to social and video, says Julia Alexander, a media correspondent for Puck News. But while it may have started with the aim of transforming negative conversations, it has, she claims, “succumbed to the hateful vitriol that defines a lot of social media”. It never stood a chance against the “unspoken but understood currency of the internet”, she adds: namely, that rage-fuelled and fearful content provokes more engagement than empathy or actually listening. “I hope that they choose to focus on creating positive content for the internet, God knows we can use it,” she says. “But I worry, because they are a company that is incentivised to continuously scale and perform better each quarter. They’ll have no choice but to continue doing more of these types of videos and just get more extreme.” Hasan, who is also a Guardian contributor, says he understands viewers’ attraction to the more extreme videos Jubilee has produced. The author of Win Every Argument, a book about the art of debating, he argues that traditional media deserted the battlefield, allowing platforms such as YouTube – now the No 1 source of televised entertainment in the US – to commandeer the space. “Mainstream media did such a shit job of facilitating debate and discussion and [giving a platform to] people with unorthodox views,” he says. “But I do think it’s a balancing act between the two extremes. Between censorship and narrowing of opinion and no standards at all, no guardrails, just put out anything you like on YouTube as long as it gets clicks.” He also understands – even agrees with – some of the criticism he has faced for going on Surrounded. The writer and disability rights advocate Imani Barbarin argued that while clips of Hasan’s takedown of far-right extremists were shared by progressives trumpeting his “win”, an equal number were shared as proof he lost. “We live in a meme-ified culture of politics,” said Barbarin, in a post on X . “Those moments are quite literally being plucked out of space and time [...] the surrounding context of that moment no longer matters.” Hasan says if he has regrets, it was that he did not find out more about the people he was facing, arguing that such extremists would be among them. But whether he regrets taking part overall? The jury is out. “I stand by what I said. I think I did a fair enough job as a debater,” he says. “The bigger meta question is whether the format itself is a problem. Is there value in doing these debates? And I don’t know the answer to that: maybe ask me in five years.”",

Hasan's experience reached a personal level when he encountered an elderly individual at a Washington event who expressed admiration for seeing Hasan engage with what he referred to as 'the 20 crazies.' This comment pointed directly to the divisive nature of the debates hosted on YouTube.\nDuring the heated exchanges, Hasan faced direct questioning regarding his ethnicity—a tactic employed by a man identified by The Guardian as having organized aggressive far-right demonstrations. In stark contrast, another participant openly declared their alignment with fascism amidst laughter and applause, only to face subsequent backlash resulting in dismissal and condemnation—yet paradoxically garnering financial backing amounting to $30,000 through Christian crowdfunding efforts.\nDespite such controversies, Hasan acknowledges the substantial viewership numbers, exceeding ten million, indicating a potent draw for younger audiences seeking political discourse. He also points out the potential benefits of engaging with this demographic segment. Concurrently, Hasan continues to expand his reach independently through his venture, Zeteo, an alternative news platform aimed at offering diverse perspectives outside traditional media narratives.",

The BJP has criticised Gandhi, accusing him of undermining the ECI and inadvertently supporting electoral roll revisions.",
        "content": "Photo: Generative AI NEW DELHI: Rahul Gandhi , long a fierce critic of the Election Commission of India (ECI), on Thursday presented what he called “criminal evidence” to back his “vote chori” charge in recent polls that left the Congress in tatters. In his presentation, the Lok Sabha leader of opposition alleged serious lapses in the electoral rolls of Mahadevapura assembly constituency, part of the Bangalore Central Lok Sabha seat in Congress-ruled Karnataka. During a press briefing, Gandhi displayed a spiral-bound stack of documents, which he said were drawn from the “7-foot pile” of electoral rolls provided by the ECI. He alleged that votes were stolen in five ways : duplicate votes, fake or invalid addresses, bulk voters at a single address, invalid photos, and misuse of Form 6 (application to add a name to the voter list in India). Rahul Gandhi with his \"proof\" at the press briefing. Interestingly, just as Rahul presented his “proof,” the Karnataka chief electoral officer wrote to him, seeking the material he had shown to the nation along with an oath-bound declaration, as a prerequisite for the probe to begin. The poll body’s letter seeking Rahul’s declaration gave the rival BJP fresh ammunition, which accused the Congress leader of “threating the institution” and claimed that by flagging loopholes in the electoral rolls, the Raebareli MP had effectively endorsed the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) in Bihar, which aims to tighten loose ends in the poll rolls. Rahul Gandhi briefing the INDIA bloc allies at his house. (PTI photo) Will Rahul submit a declaration? Rahul Gandhi did not appear to budge on the EC notice, saying: \"I'm saying it publicly to everybody. Take it as an oath. This is their data, and we are displaying their data. This is not our data.\" Rahul Gandhi with a document, which he claimed has a compilation of fake and invalid addresses enrolled in the electoral roll of Mahadevapura assembly constituency. (PTI photo) On whether the Congress leader would submit a declaration to the ECI, Congress leader Udit Raj told TOI: \"The Election Commission will try to find certain things in that, whether right or wrong. Then the BJP will take over that, and finally, they'll try to dilute it. Why is the Election Commission not answering? Why will CCTV footage be destroyed in 45 days when data can be stored for 100 years? \" He was referring to ECI's order to state poll officers to destroy election CCTV, webcasting, and video footage 45 days after the results, if no court challenge is filed. Rahul Gandhi Releases New Video, Claims More 'Proof' On EC, BJP Collusion in Voter List Fraud When asked if the Congress party would move the Supreme Court in case the deadlock with the Election Commission continues, the former Lok Sabha MP said: \"Our court is public. The way one judge has made a frivolous and strange comment about Rahul Gandhi. BJP MP has said that China has encroached on the land. Ladakh people are crying, even satellite pictures have shown how much land has been encroached, and here the judge says: Give the proof. What to do? If there are certain judges like these, what to do? They will turn down. \" However, he added, \"definitely we believe in the institutions, provided that the institutions give justice. Institutions were created by Congress, but when institutions are subverted and pressure is built, then, of course, we have to fight, and finally, there's a people's court, which is the highest court for a political party. On the question of whether the INDIA bloc would boycott the upcoming election if the issue remains unresolved, he said: \"We will resort to all kinds of methodologies to fight it out. Any option which is available within the framework of democracy, we will exercise that.\" Did the BJP 'collude' with ECI? Responding to Rahul Gandhi's \"ECI colluding with BJP\" charge, national BJP spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari told TOI: \"If ECI was colluding with the BJP, Rahul Gandhi would not have won his seat in Amethi, his sister would not have won her seat in Wayanad. Congress party government would not have been there in Telangana, Karnataka and the opposition government in Jharkhand and Tamil Nadu.\" When asked if the ECI should probe into Rahul's claim, even if he refuses to submit the declaration, Bhandari said: \"That is under the purview of the wisdom of the Election Commission.\" He, however, added that in case the Congress leader refuses to submit the declaration along with his \"proof\", it would become clear that Rahul Gandhi has \"lied again\". \"The Election Commission has asked Rahul Gandhi for an oath, and if he doesn't give in writing it will be clear that, like he lied about Rafale, China-occupied Indian territory...Rahul Gandhi is yet again lying because he wants to divert attention from his imminent loss in Bihar,\" Pradeep Bhandari told TOI. Will SIR now get the INDIA bloc's nod? The opposition INDIA bloc has vehemently criticised the intensive roll revision in Bihar, questioning the timing of the exercise and the alleged \"haste\" with which the entire process is being conducted in the poll-bound state. \"We are questioning the timing. 35 BLOs are sitting in one place, and they are filling up the form. So 70 per cent of voters have not been approved. On their behalf, forms have been filled up and are incomplete. In some places, \" Trump and Dogbabu's \" names have appeared. Not even one booth is perfect,\" Udit Raj alleged. Donald Trump, Shri Ram, Kaua (Crow) As Bihar Local: Oppn Flags Bizarre Applications In SIR Countering Rahul Gandhi's criticism of SIR, Pradeep Bhandari said: \"Earlier, it was EVM, then the voter list went to Maharashtra, where the Bombay high court dismissed the plea. Now, a new thing has come, SIR. In the presentation that Rahul Gandhi showed, even there, Rahul inadvertently became a proponent of SIR rather than opposing it.\" ALSO READ: ECI questions Rahul Gandhi’s ‘fake votes’ claim; cites Karnataka govt’s use of same rolls for caste census \"Let Rahul Gandhi and the RJD go to the voters of Bihar with this as an agenda, we will go with our developmental agenda,\" he said, adding: \"Only person who should worry is Tejashwi Yadav, whose two voter IDs were found, and he is to answer how a leader of the opposition party in Bihar was holding two voter ID cards.\" Whether Rahul Gandhi’s claims trigger a serious probe or fade into another round of political crossfire now rests in the court of public opinion. Notwithstanding, the episode has become a test of credibility for both sides, with its outcome likely to shape how future challenges to voter lists are addressed and how much trust the public places in the electoral process.",

Gandhi presented a series of documents purportedly demonstrating instances where votes could have been unlawfully cast—an allegation known colloquially among politicians as 'vote chori.'\nGandhi's allegations came after the ECI reported discrepancies within the electoral rolls of Mahadevapura assembly constituency—a segment of the larger Bangalore Central Lok Sabha seat—which falls under the jurisdiction of the Congress-led state government. In a press conference held in New Delhi, Gandhi showcased a collection of papers extracted from a substantial volume supplied by the ECI itself. These papers allegedly revealed various forms of vote manipulation including duplicate voting records, fraudulent or invalid residential addresses, concentration of multiple voters at one location, use of incorrect photographs, and improper handling of Form 6 applications used to register new voters.\nThe ECI responded promptly to these claims by requesting Gandhi to furnish an oath-bound declaration alongside his submitted evidence if he wished to proceed with initiating a formal investigation into the matter. This request was communicated via written correspondence directed towards Gandhi himself.\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), currently holding power at the national level, seized upon Gandhi's public accusation as an opportunity to criticize him further. They argued that by bringing attention to flaws within the electoral system, Gandhi was essentially threatening the integrity of the ECI and unintentionally lending support to measures like the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) being implemented in Bihar—a move aimed at rectifying inaccuracies found within election rolls.\nDespite facing pressure from both sides—the ECI demanding official declarations and the BJP challenging his motives—Gandhi remained steadfast in his position. He insisted that his intention was merely to highlight genuine concerns about the electoral process rather than undermine the authority of the ECI.",

Carlo Raso/ Flickr, CC BY-SA“No Kings” rallies. “Good Trouble” protests. “Rage against the Regime” uprisings. These events in the first seven months of President Donald Trump’s second term, along with public opinion polls, show that many Americans are concerned about Trump’s expansive use of executive power.Views on this issue often have a partisan slant. Republicans express more concern about presidential power when Democrats control the White House, and vice versa. But many in both parties prefer that U.S. political leaders work through established channels, rather than through unconventional actions that may pose challenges to the Constitution and the rule of law, such as mass firings and large-scale deportations. Greek historian and ethnographer Herodotus lived from about 484 B.C.E. to about 425 B.C.E. Metropolitan Museum of Art/Wikimedia As a professor of classics, I know that concerns about authoritarianism go back thousands of years. One early discussion appears in the work of the fifth-century B.C.E. Greek writer Herodotus, whose “History” – sometimes called “Histories” – is considered the first great prose narrative in Western literature. In it, Herodotus analyzed the Persian invasion of Greece – the defining event of his time. To understand how Greece, a much smaller power, achieved a major victory over Persia, Herodotus explored the nature of effective leadership, which he saw as a critical factor in the conflict’s outcome.A shocking upsetPersia was already a vast empire when it invaded Greece, a tiny country made up of independent city-states. The Persians expected a quick and easy victory. Instead, the Greco-Persian Wars lasted over a decade, from 490 to 479 B.C.E. They ended with Greece defeating the Persians – a shocking upset. Consequently, Persia abandoned its westward expansion, while various Greek city-states formed a tenuous alliance that lasted nearly 50 years.To explain this unexpected outcome, Herodotus described how Persian and Greek societies developed before this crucial conflict. In his view, the fact that many Greek city-states had representative governments enabled the Greek victory. These systems allowed individuals to participate in discussing strategies and resulted in the Greeks uniting to fight for freedom. For example, when the Persian fleet was headed toward mainland Greece, the Athenian general Miltiades says, “Never before have we been in such extreme danger. If we give in to the Persians, we will suffer greatly under the tyrant Hippias.”Herodotus tended to put his political philosophies into the mouths of historical figures such as Miltiades. He condensed his thoughts about government into what historians call the “Constitutional Debate,” a fictional conversation among three real characters: Persian noblemen named Otanes, Megabazus and Darius. A fragment from Herodotus’ ‘Histories,’ Book VIII, on papyrus, dated to the early second century C.E. Sackler Library, Oxford/Wikimedia Persia’s ascentFor centuries prior to invading Greece, Persia had been a small region inhabited by various ancient Iranian peoples and controlled by the neighboring kingdom of Media. Then, in 550 B.C.E., King Cyrus II of Persia overthrew the Medes and expanded Persian territory into what became the Achaemenid Empire. Thanks to his effective leadership and tolerance for the customs of cultures he conquered, historians call him “Cyrus the Great.”His son and successor, Cambyses, was less successful. He added Egypt to the Persian empire, but according to Herodotus, Cambyses acted erratically and cruelly. He desecrated the pharaoh’s tomb, mocked the Egyptians’ gods, and killed their sacred Apis bull. He also demanded that Persian judges change the laws so that he could marry his own sisters. After Cambyses died childless, various factions vied for the Persian throne. Herodotus set his discussion about alternative political systems in this unstable period. The case for democracyOtanes, the first speaker in the Constitutional Debate, says “the time has passed for any one man among us to have absolute power.” He recommends that the Persian people themselves handle state affairs. “How can monarchy continue to be our norm, when a monarch can do whatever he wants, with no accountability whatsoever?” Otanes asks. Even worse, a monarch “disrupts the laws,” as Cambyses did. Otanes favors rule by the many, which he calls “isonomia,” meaning “equality under the law.” In this system, he explains, politicians are elected and held responsible for their behavior and make decisions transparently. Today, unlike Otanes, Republican members of Congress appear reluctant to hold Trump responsible for anything or ensure transparency within the administration. Prominent Democrats, including U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, are challenging Trump administration actions that they view as lawless, such as freezing of funds authorized by Congress.Do oligarchs know better?Otanes’ fellow nobleman, Megabazus, agrees that the Persians should abolish monarchy, but he raises concerns about rule by the people. “The masses are useless – there’s nothing more witless and violent than a crowd,” Megabazus asserts. He believes “commoners” don’t understand the intricacies of policymaking. Instead, Megabazus suggests oligarchy, or “rule by a few.” Choose the best men in Persia and let them rule everyone else, he urges, because they “will naturally come up with the best ideas.” But Megabazus doesn’t explain who would qualify as “the best men” or who would select them.The U.S. has occasionally resembled an oligarchy, with small, elite groups holding most political power. For example, Article 1, Section 3 of the original Constitution provided for election of senators by state legislators, not directly by the people. Senators were not elected by popular vote until the 17th Amendment passed in 1913. More recently, Trump has received millions of dollars in support from billionaire tech industry leaders such as Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos, who hope to influence antitrust policy and deregulation. The Department of Government Efficiency, headed by Musk before he stepped down in May 2025, is now run by young men with virtually no government experience. DOGE’s cuts to programs such as humanitarian aid are wreaking havoc across the globe.What about monarchy?The third speaker, Darius, sees democracy and oligarchy as equally flawed. He points out that even well-intentioned oligarchs fight among themselves because “each wants his own opinion to prevail.” This leads to hatred and worse, much like the Trump-Musk relationship gone sour.Rather, Darius asserts, “using good judgment, a monarch will be a flawless guardian of the people.” He argues that since Persia was freed by one man, King Cyrus II, Persians should maintain their traditional monarchy. Darius doesn’t explain how to ensure a monarch’s good judgment. But his argument wins out. It had to, since in reality Darius became Persia’s next king. Kings, or shahs, ruled Persia – it became known as Iran in 1935 – until the Iranian Revolution of 1979 eliminated the monarchy and established the Islamic Republic of Iran. Trump is not technically a monarch, but some believe he acts like one. He and his administration have ignored court orders, preempted the powers of Congress and sought to silence his critics by attacking protected free speech. Protesters carry a banner representing the preamble to the U.S. Constitution in downtown Los Angeles during an anti-Trump demonstration on June 14, 2025. Mario Tama/Getty Images Lessons from HerodotusHerodotus himself was largely pro-democracy, but his Constitutional Debate doesn’t endorse one form of government. Instead, it highlights principles of good leadership. These include accountability, moderation and respect for “nomos,” a Greek term encompassing the concepts of custom and law. Herodotus emphasizes: “Formerly great cities have become small, while small cities have become great.” Human fortune changes constantly, and Persia’s failure to conquer Greece is just one example. History has seen the rise and fall of many world powers. Is the United States next? Herodotus viewed the Persian monarchy, whose kings believed their own authority was paramount, as the weakness that led to their astounding defeat in 479 B.C.E.Debbie Felton is affiliated with the Democratic Party (registered to vote).",

During President Trump's second term's initial seven months, 'No Kings,' 'Good Trouble,' and 'Rage against the Regime' movements highlighted American concerns regarding Trump's extensive use of executive power. Partisan views influence perceptions of presidential authority, yet there is bipartisan preference for traditional governance methods. Herodotus' analysis of the Persian-Greek wars emphasized the importance of leadership in determining historical outcomes.",
        "ai_content": "In the annals of history, authoritarian regimes have been a recurring theme, one that even the ancient Greek historian Herodotus addressed centuries ago. Living around 484 to 425 B.C.E., Herodotus chronicled significant events like the Persian invasion of Greece—a pivotal moment that shaped his era. His seminal work, known as 'The Histories,' delves deep into the dynamics of leadership and its profound effect on national destinies.\nFast forward to modern times, during President Donald Trump's tenure, particularly in his second term's first half, America witnessed numerous demonstrations under banners such as 'No Kings,' 'Good Trouble,' and 'Rage against the Regime.' These gatherings reflected widespread apprehension towards Trump's broad exercise of executive powers. Public sentiment on this matter tends to align with party lines; however, across the aisle, there's a shared inclination among citizens favoring conventional democratic processes over radical measures potentially threatening constitutional integrity and legal norms.\nThis dichotomy echoes sentiments expressed millennia earlier by Herodotus. As a classicist scholar specializing in antiquity, I've observed that anxieties concerning autocratic tendencies aren't novel—they've persisted throughout history. Herodotus himself scrutinized these themes within his magnum opus, exploring not just military conquests but also societal structures and governance models.\nHis account begins with Persia—an empire sprawling across continents—clashing with Greece, a coalition of small city-states. Contrary to expectations of swift conquest, the protracted Greco-Persian Wars spanned ten years (490–479 B.C.E.), culminating in a surprising triumph for Greece. This defeat forced Persia to halt its western ambitions and prompted disparate Greek states to forge alliances enduring almost five decades.\nTo comprehend why such an unlikely victory occurred, Herodotus examined pre-war developments in both empires. He posited that the Greeks' relatively advanced systems of representation played a role in their resilience and success.",

        "ai_content": "In recent developments reported by the evening news, India's financial landscape faces significant shifts with potential repercussions across various sectors. A study from State Bank of India indicates that halting Russian oil imports immediately could lead to a spike in India's fuel expenses, potentially increasing the nation's fuel bill by approximately $12 billion in the upcoming fiscal year 2027. This projection comes against the backdrop of heightened tensions following Western-imposed sanctions on Russia since February 2022, which have prompted India to secure discounted Russian crude oil below the $60 per barrel threshold to ensure energy stability.\nThe central government's legislative agenda saw a notable change when Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman decided to retract the Income Tax Bill, 2025, previously presented in the Lok Sabha. She announced intentions to resubmit a modified draft reflecting suggestions made by a select committee later than initially planned. The reintroduced legislation is expected to address concerns raised earlier and aims to pass through Parliament once again before August 11th.\nAmidst these domestic policy adjustments, political controversies continue unabated. Following claims of manipulated voter rolls, Rahul Gandhi faced pressure from election authorities in Karnataka, along with those in Maharashtra and Haryana, urging him to substantiate his accusations under oath. Gandhi responded critically towards the electoral bodies involved, emphasizing the sanctity of democratic processes and calling out what he perceives as attempts to undermine them.\nOn the international front, geopolitical dynamics remain tense.

        "content": "Haley Popp has always had a close relationship with her mom . The 44-year-old from Flower Mound, Texas, respectfully disagreed with her mother’s conservative views . But they could always set aside their political differences to connect. That changed in 2016. Haley’s parents, Mary Lou and Bob Kultgen, became avid supporters of President Donald Trump and his call to “Make America Great Again.” Haley and her brother, Chad Kultgen, disagreed. Vehemently. The political tension reached its peak during the pandemic. Every conversation Haley and Chad had with their parents turned into a fight over politics. They blocked each other on social media. Haley went from speaking on the phone with her mother every day to going months without talking. “I always considered my mom one of my best friends... It was sad,” Haley said. “It was a hard time. I thought I might not be able to talk to my parents again.” “It was ripping my heart out,” said Mary Lou, 70, who lives in Edmond, Oklahoma. Their situation was not unlike many family dynamics in the U.S. They later found a way to repair theirs. A survey conducted before the 2024 presidential election found that 1 in 5 Americans had become estranged from a family member, blocked a family member on social media or skipped a family event due to disagreements over controversial topics such as politics, according to the American Psychiatric Association. “Our current environment has become increasingly polarized,” APA CEO and medical director Dr. Marketa Wills said in October 2024. “Some of us will find ourselves having heated conversations and disagreements on sensitive issues, even with the people we are close to. Sometimes these discussions represent healthy debate, and other times they may cross the line into incivility if emotions flare.” In 2022, Chad decided he had had enough. He didn’t know how much time he had left with his parents and he didn’t want to spend those remaining years estranged. If the only way he could speak to his parents was fighting over politics, he said, then bring it on. “The only time we could lock in was by talking politics,” said Chad, 44, who lives in Los Angeles. “I thought why not do this as a podcast because it would regiment the need for us to get together every week for one hour.” Read up: Gen Z men, women have a deep political divide. It's made dating a nightmare He approached Haley with the idea. She said to herself, “We have nothing to lose, so why not?” The podcast, dubbed “The Necessary Conversation Podcast,” ended up saving the family. Bickering on the podcast for an hour every Sunday allowed them to focus on other things outside of the show. If anyone mentioned politics during a family gathering or casual phone call, Chad encouraged them to “save it for the podcast,\" which he called their \"therapy.\" “That’s our one hour for yipping and fighting and going after each other,” Mary Lou said. “The podcast is only a sliver of our real lives and what we mean to each other.” In case you missed: What do moms really want for Mother's Day? We need to talk about it. Now, the siblings visit their parents’ barn in Oklahoma and attend Kansas State University football games together. Haley even helped her father during his recovery from a second hip surgery. They still don’t agree on politics, but they’ve learned to listen to one another and sympathize. Chad hopes he can show other families that it's possible to repair familial relationships despite political differences. \"My relationship with my parents was more important than my relationship wth Donald Trump ,\" he said. Mary Lou agreed. \"Politics is not worth losing family members over or losing the love for your family,\" she said. \"It's just not worth it.\" Adrianna Rodriguez can be reached at adrodriguez@usatoday.com.

Haley Popp's story exemplifies this trend; she grew up in harmony with her politically divergent parents until Trump's presidency intensified their disputes. After years of conflict, particularly during the pandemic when political arguments dominated interactions, Haley and her brother Chad chose to reconnect through a weekly podcast discussing politics instead of avoiding confrontation. This approach allowed them to maintain contact despite differing viewpoints.",
        "ai_content": "In recent years, familial bonds have been tested across the United States, with a significant number of individuals finding common ground elusive amidst divisive national debates. According to a pre-2024 presidential election survey cited by the American Psychiatric Association, approximately 20% of Americans reported becoming estranged from relatives due to conflicts arising from polarizing topics including politics. This phenomenon reflects broader societal trends where ideological rifts often lead to personal discord within families.\nHaley Popp, a resident of Flower Mound, Texas, experienced firsthand the strain that political disagreement can place on relationships. At 44, Haley maintained a strong connection with her mother, Mary Lou, and father, Bob Kultgen, which endured despite their contrasting stances—her mother's conservative leanings versus her father's support for President Donald Trump and his 'Make America Great Again' campaign. However, the political landscape shifted dramatically after Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 election, leading to heightened tensions between Haley and her siblings, Chad Kultgen and sister-in-law Haley Popp.\nThe family's discord escalated throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, transforming what were once daily calls into infrequent communications marred by political clashes. Social media further exacerbated the divide, resulting in mutual blocks among family members. For Haley, whose bond with her mother was deeply cherished, the prospect of losing regular communication was distressing. She expressed profound sadness at the potential loss of friendship—a sentiment echoed by her mother, now aged 70 and residing in Edmond, Oklahoma.\nChad Kultgen eventually sought resolution following his diagnosis with cancer in 2022. Confronted with limited time ahead, he resolved to bridge the gap created by their political differences rather than let it consume their final moments together. His solution? A weekly podcast dedicated solely to discussing politics—the very subject that had driven them apart. By structuring their dialogues around shared interests yet diverging beliefs, Chad aimed to foster understanding while preserving their familial ties.\nThis innovative approach underscores a growing recognition that respectful discourse—even amid disagreement—is possible and perhaps necessary for maintaining connections in today's polarized climate.",

        "description": "A 2024 survey found 1 in 5 Americans have become estranged from a family member due to disagreements on controversial topics.",
        "content": "Haley Popp has always had a close relationship with her mom . The 44-year-old from Flower Mound, Texas, respectfully disagreed with her mother’s conservative views . But they could always set aside their political differences to connect. That changed in 2016. Haley’s parents, Mary Lou and Bob Kultgen, became avid supporters of President Donald Trump and his call to “Make America Great Again.” Haley and her brother, Chad Kultgen, disagreed. Vehemently. The political tension reached its peak during the pandemic. Every conversation Haley and Chad had with their parents turned into a fight over politics. They blocked each other on social media. Haley went from speaking on the phone with her mother every day to going months without talking. “I always considered my mom one of my best friends... It was sad,” Haley said. “It was a hard time. I thought I might not be able to talk to my parents again.” “It was ripping my heart out,” said Mary Lou, 70, who lives in Edmond, Oklahoma. Their situation was not unlike many family dynamics in the U.S. They later found a way to repair theirs. A survey conducted before the 2024 presidential election found that 1 in 5 Americans had become estranged from a family member, blocked a family member on social media or skipped a family event due to disagreements over controversial topics such as politics, according to the American Psychiatric Association. “Our current environment has become increasingly polarized,” APA CEO and medical director Dr. Marketa Wills said in October 2024. “Some of us will find ourselves having heated conversations and disagreements on sensitive issues, even with the people we are close to. Sometimes these discussions represent healthy debate, and other times they may cross the line into incivility if emotions flare.” In 2022, Chad decided he had had enough. He didn’t know how much time he had left with his parents and he didn’t want to spend those remaining years estranged. If the only way he could speak to his parents was fighting over politics, he said, then bring it on. “The only time we could lock in was by talking politics,” said Chad, 44, who lives in Los Angeles. “I thought why not do this as a podcast because it would regiment the need for us to get together every week for one hour.” He approached Haley with the idea. She said to herself, “We have nothing to lose, so why not?” The podcast, dubbed “The Necessary Conversation Podcast,” ended up saving the family. Bickering on the podcast for an hour every Sunday allowed them to focus on other things outside of the show. If anyone mentioned politics during a family gathering or casual phone call, Chad encouraged them to “save it for the podcast,\" which he called their \"therapy.\" “That’s our one hour for yipping and fighting and going after each other,” Mary Lou said. “The podcast is only a sliver of our real lives and what we mean to each other.” Now, the siblings visit their parents’ barn in Oklahoma and attend Kansas State University football games together. Haley even helped her father during his recovery from a second hip surgery. They still don’t agree on politics, but they’ve learned to listen to one another and sympathize. Chad hopes he can show other families that it's possible to repair familial relationships despite political differences. \"My relationship with my parents was more important than my relationship wth Donald Trump ,\" he said. Mary Lou agreed. \"Politics is not worth losing family members over or losing the love for your family,\" she said. \"It's just not worth it.\" Adrianna Rodriguez can be reached at adrodriguez@usatoday.com.",

        "ai_summary": "A 2024 survey revealed that 20% of Americans have distanced themselves from family members over contentious subjects like politics. Haley Popp's story exemplifies this trend; she grew up in harmony with her politically divergent parents until Trump's presidency intensified their disputes. After years of conflict, particularly during the pandemic when political arguments dominated interactions, Haley and her brother Chad chose to reconnect through a weekly podcast discussing politics instead of avoiding confrontation. This approach allowed them to maintain contact despite differing viewpoints.",
        "ai_content": "In recent years, familial bonds have been tested across the United States amidst rising polarization, especially around hot-button issues such as politics. According to a pre-2024 presidential election survey cited by the American Psychiatric Association, approximately 20% of Americans reported becoming estranged from relatives due to ideological clashes. One poignant case study involves Haley Popp, a 44-year-old resident of Flower Mound, Texas, whose once-close relationship with her mother suffered under the weight of political discord.\nHaley's father, Bob Kultgen, along with his wife, Mary Lou, embraced President Donald Trump's 'Make America Great Again' campaign fervently after 2016—a stance that clashed sharply with Haley's own beliefs. As tensions escalated throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, what were once daily calls between mother and daughter transformed into confrontational exchanges centered solely on politics. Social media further exacerbated the rift, leading to mutual blocks and severed communication lines.\nThe emotional toll was profound for both parties involved. Haley expressed deep sadness at losing regular interaction with her mother, while Mary Lou lamented the pain inflicted upon her daughter's happiness. Despite these challenges, Haley remained hopeful for reconciliation.\nChad Kultgen shared similar sentiments regarding his strained relationship with his parents. At age 44 and living in Los Angeles, Chad recognized the limited time he had left with his loved ones and sought a constructive outlet for their ongoing debates. His solution? A weekly podcast dedicated exclusively to discussing politics—an arrangement that provided structure and purpose to their interactions.\nThis innovative compromise reflects a broader societal shift where families navigate complex dialogues within the context of increased partisanship. While some view these discussions as opportunities for meaningful engagement, others fear they border on uncivil behavior fueled by strong emotions.\nAs America's political landscape continues to evolve, stories like Haley and Chad's serve as reminders of the delicate balance required to sustain relationships amid deeply held convictions.",

        "description": "Egypt, Israel and Britain have ruled the beleaguered territory",
        "content": "Occupying Gaza is the only way to ensure Israel's security and wipe out Hamas, claimed Benjamin Netanyahu as he announced that the Israeli army will \"take control of Gaza City\". The UN said that the move risks \"catastrophic consequences\" for Palestinian civilians and Israeli hostages, and there has also been condemnation from world leaders, the Israeli military and relatives of the hostages. Who owns Gaza? Before Israel was established in 1948, the area now known as Gaza was \"part of the large swathe\" of the Middle East that was under British colonial rule, said South China Morning Post . Upon the foundation of Israel, 700,000 Palestinians either fled or were forced from their homes. Tens of thousands of them \"flocked\" to the \"strip of land wedged between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea\", which was handed to the control of the Egyptian army. During the Six-Day War of 1967, Israel took control of Gaza from Egypt and began to build settlements on the land. Then, after Israel and the Palestinians agreed the Oslo Accords in 1993, control of Gaza was handed to the Palestinian Authority (PA). In 2005, Israel performed a unilateral withdrawal from Gaza, uprooting all of its troops and thousands of settlers . Within months, Hamas won parliamentary elections in Gaza and aggressively seized control of the territory from the PA. In response, Israel imposed a strict blockade on Gaza, which some argued was another form of occupation. What is the legal definition of 'occupation'? According to Article 42 of the 1907 Hague Regulations a territory is considered occupied \"when it is actually placed under the authority of the hostile army\". Israel is not a party to the Fourth Hague Convention but it's \"considered customary international law\" and, therefore it \"still binds Israel\", said Atlantic Council . What might happen next? There are fears that settler movements may seize the opportunity to try and return to Gaza , said Leonie Fleischmann on The Conversation . Since Israel began its \"onslaught\" in the strip, settler groups have been calling for the resettlement of Gaza and although it's \"not yet clear\" whether Netanyahu plans to allow the establishment of civilian settlements there, \"historical precedent makes this a very real possibility\". Some have speculated, however, that the \"threat of full occupation\" is just part of a \"strategy\" to pressure Hamas to make concessions in \"stalled talks\", said Hugo Bachega, the BBC's Middle East correspondent. \"We don't want to govern it. We don't want to be there as a governing body,\" Netanyahu has said. We \"want to hand it over to Arab forces that will govern it properly without threatening us and giving Gazans a good life.\" How these aims are realised is less than clear, as Jonathan Sacerdoti noted in The Spectator . \"Politically\", the notion of \"long-term Israeli security control over Gaza\" without annexation or direct governance presents an \"unsolved riddle: who will take responsibility for civil life once the guns fall silent\"?",

This announcement followed historical context where Gaza shifted hands among Egypt, Israel, and Britain before becoming a focal point post-1948 when many Palestinians fled or were expelled. After various conflicts and agreements like the Oslo Accords, Hamas gained power leading to increased tensions and Israel imposing a blockade. International bodies warned of dire humanitarian impacts while global leaders expressed disapproval.",
        "ai_content": "In a significant development concerning regional geopolitics, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asserted that occupying Gaza City is essential for safeguarding Israel’s security interests and eradicating the influence of Hamas. This statement comes amidst escalating tensions following Hamas' recent actions, with Netanyahu emphasizing the necessity of taking decisive measures within Gaza.\nHistorically, the region now recognized as Gaza has seen numerous shifts in sovereignty since the mid-20th century. Initially under British colonial administration, the territory became embroiled in conflict upon the establishment of Israel in 1948, resulting in mass displacement of approximately 700,000 Palestinians. Many sought refuge along the narrow coastal strip bordered by Israel, Egypt, and the Mediterranean Sea—a zone subsequently controlled by the Egyptian military force.\nThe landscape further evolved during the Six-Day War in 1967 when Israel expanded its territorial holdings to include Gaza. Subsequent peace efforts materialized through the Oslo Accords in 1993, transferring governance responsibilities to the newly formed Palestinian Authority (PA). However, the political equilibrium was disrupted once again in 2005 when Israel unilaterally withdrew its forces from Gaza, leaving behind a vacuum soon filled by Hamas’ ascendancy following electoral victory.\nThis shift prompted Israel to enforce stringent maritime restrictions aimed at curtailing arms smuggling into Gaza—an action widely interpreted as tantamount to de facto occupation. Despite these measures being contested legally due to Israel's non-participation in certain international conventions such as the Fourth Hague Convention, they remain subject to scrutiny under customary international law principles.\nAmidst growing apprehensions regarding potential repercussions—including possible reestablishment of Jewish settlements—the international community voiced alarm over the prospect of catastrophic outcomes for Gazan residents and Israeli captives alike. Notably, United Nations officials cautioned against the severe implications of such military operations, underscoring the risk posed to innocent lives caught in the crossfire.\nAs geopolitical dynamics continue to evolve, speculation abounds regarding future strategies employed by Israel to exert leverage over Hamas. While concrete details remain elusive, historical patterns suggest possibilities ranging from renewed settlement initiatives to intensified diplomatic pressures.",

        "description": "Donald Trump’s fanbase in India had begun to ebb even before the tariff war, and the real unravelling started when he claimed to have brokered peace between India and Pakistan during Operation Sindoor.",
        "content": "Dear readers, Those blowing the trumpet for Donald Trump in India have been, well, trumped. The US President’s announcement this week of a 50 per cent tariff on India has left his Indian superfans scrambling for new mantras. Until recently, some were busy performing yagnas and chanting the Mahamrityunjay mantra for his re-election. Now, they find themselves in need of a new hymn sheet. As Trump turned up the heat over India’s Russian oil purchases, social media was quick to strike back with a flurry of new barbs. “Tariff TANTRUMP” did the rounds, as did a Hindi riff inspired by an old film song: “ Trump Hai Ki Maanta Nahin, Bharat ko Jaanta Nahin ”—a reminder that Trump doesn’t quite see reality, and doesn’t even know India. The memes practically wrote themselves: “ Trump Ka Tariff Bam, Arthavyavastha Ka Niklega Dum? ” (Will Trump’s tariff bomb will shake up the economy?) After the 50 per cent tariff news broke, Minister of State (Agriculture) Bhagirath Chaudhary addressed reporters outside Parliament: “It is not unknown why Trump is rattled ( baukhlaaye huye hain) . Trump will soon find out what a man of determination and firmness Modi ji is. The Prime Minister isn’t about to blink for anyone, least of all Trump.” So much for the celebrated chemistry between Modi and Trump. We now have what you might call Trumpistry—the art of falling out in public. Meanwhile, AAP Rajya Sabha MP and Lovely Professional University Chancellor Ashok Kumar Mittal dashed off an open letter to Trump, warning that if Indians imposed strategic restrictions on American business, Washington, DC, would feel a far more “severe” pinch. The government, for its part, declared the targeting of India “unjustified and unreasonable”, promising to safeguard national interests. Online, the jibes kept coming: “ Trump Chacha Zoom Kar Lena (Zoom in, Uncle Trump),” one post on X advised, while another quipped, “Yeh trade war nahi , TRP war hai! [This is a TRP war!]” But there’s more to this than Trump’s theatrics. Something’s definitely cooking. For years, fascination with Trump in India has bordered on the surreal. Trump Towers now dot the skylines of Mumbai, Gurugram, and Pune; Gurugram even claims two, rivalling New York. Plans for a third tower in Noida are underway. Just a year ago, as Trump sought re-election, right-wing groups across India organised pujas for his victory. One mahamandaleshwar led a havan (a Hindu fire ritual) in Delhi’s Shahdara, conch shells and vermilion at the ready, and Trump’s posters were adorned with “Friend Forever” captions featuring Modi. After the failed assassination attempt on Trump at a Pennsylvania rally last July, Delhi’s Hindu Sena held a special havan for Trump’s well-being, with priests chanting the Mahamrityunjay mantra 1.25 lakh times—just in case the Secret Service was running low on options. Even the diaspora joined in: a branch of Hindu Sena tried to hold a havan in California in 2020. Back in 2016, a Mumbai temple hosted two yagnas for Trump’s victory. If nothing else, he’s been good for the incense trade. Alas, the decade-long Indian romance with Trump’s strongman image has lost its lustre. Trump’s fanbase here had begun to ebb even before the tariff war, and the real unravelling started when he claimed to have brokered peace between India and Pakistan during Operation Sindoor. This blew up in Parliament: Rahul Gandhi challenged Modi to call out the lie, while the RJD MP Manoj Jha drew laughs comparing Trump to Chacha Chaudhary—the comic-book uncle whose brain works faster than a computer. “I can see all the negative traits of Chacha Chaudhary in Trump,” Jha quipped, proposing a tongue-in-cheek resolution to brand Trump the “epitaph of the greatest lawyer of the century”. Social media had long discovered Chaudhary Trump. AI-generated memes show him reclining on a charpoy in full Haryana regalia, receiving a Nobel Peace Prize desi style, or selling kulfi on YouTube. One viral video stars Trump in a white kurta and pagdi (turban), with “Chaudhary Trump Zindabad” emblazoned below. Another right-wing X handle, on June 24, shared “THE CEASEFIRE CHAUDHARY CHACHA TRUMP”, complete with Trump’s post about the Israel-Iran ceasefire. In Bihar, things took an even more theatrical turn: during the recent Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls, a prankster in Samastipur district submitted an online application for a residence certificate in Trump’s name, complete with his real parents’ names—Frederick Christ Trump and Mary Anne MacLeod—and a listed address in Hassanpur village. The State administration, still red-faced over an earlier certificate issued to “Dog Babu”, registered an FIR with the Cyber Police. The opposition, led by the Congress, went to town calling it the ultimate proof of electoral fraud in Bihar. Of course, Trump is trending in more mundane ways, too. Amazon now sells a Chacha Trump Trucking Pullover Hoodie in case your wardrobe has a diplomatic incident. Indians like having someone to worship, and Trump’s fading will be sorely felt. Unless—this is just a lover’s tiff, and a Modi-Trump patch-up takes place. Let us know what you are rooting for: break-up or patch-up.

        "ai_summary": "Donald Trump's popularity among his supporters in India began to decline following his announcement of a 50% tariff on Indian goods amid tensions over India's purchase of Russian oil. Social media reacted swiftly with satirical posts criticizing Trump's understanding of India. In response, Indian officials expressed confidence in their leader's resolve against such tariffs, hinting at potential retaliatory measures from India towards U.S. businesses. The situation reflects growing discontent with Trump's policies within India, where admiration for him once seemed widespread.",
        "ai_content": "In recent weeks, the fervor for former President Donald Trump amongst certain segments of his Indian audience appears to have cooled significantly. This shift came into sharp focus after Trump announced a steep 50% tariff on various Indian products amidst escalating trade disputes related to India's procurement of Russian oil. The move sparked immediate backlash across social media platforms, with users crafting witty and critical responses under hashtags like 'Tariff TANTRUMP' and mocking lyrics reminiscent of Bollywood songs questioning Trump's grasp on reality regarding India.\nThe sentiment reached official channels too, with Minister of State for Agriculture Bhagirath Chaudhary publicly stating that it wasn't surprising Trump felt agitated ('baukhlaaye huye hain') given the circumstances. He further suggested that Trump would quickly realize the steadfastness and decisiveness of India's current Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, who showed no intention of yielding easily.\nAdding to the discourse, AAP Rajya Sabha MP Ashok Kumar Mittal penned an open letter to Trump cautioning that imposing strategic limitations on American enterprises could lead to significant repercussions for Washington D.C., potentially resulting in a harsher impact than anticipated.\nThe Indian government's stance was firm, labeling the imposition of tariffs as unjustified and pledging protection of national interests. Amidst these developments, online commentary continued unabated, with suggestions ranging from urging Trump to confront Modi directly to declaring the unfolding events as a 'TRP war,' indicating a battle waged through television ratings rather than traditional politics.\nThis episode marks a notable departure from the previously held adulation for Trump in India—a country where his presence was symbolized by towering edifices rivaling those in New York City itself. The narrative around Trump's influence seems poised for transformation as India navigates these complex international waters.",

        "description": "Gandhi had also presented the EPIC number of a person named Aditya Srivastava from Lucknow claiming that in addition to Karnataka, he was also a voter in UP",
        "content": "Rahul Gandhi alleged that there was 'vote chori' of over 1 lakh votes in Mahadevapura Assembly segment in Bangalore during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The Election Commission (EC) on Friday asked Congress MP and Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi to either sign a formal declaration under the law or apologise to the nation for levelling false allegations of large-scale electoral fraud. Karnataka Chief Electoral Officer issued a letter to Gandhi asking him to submit the evidence under oath under Rule 20 (3) (b) of the Registration of Electors Rules 1960. EC sources told ANI that if Gandhi believes that his allegations against the poll panel are true, he should have no problem in signing the declaration. “If Rahul Gandhi does not sign the Declaration, it would mean that he does not believe in his analysis and resultant conclusions and absurd allegations. In which case, he should apologise to the nation. Therefore, he has two options: Either sign the Declaration or apologise to the Nation for raising absurd allegations against ECI,” said the poll body. Rahul Gandhi’s response Gandhi reiterated his vote theft allegations and slammed the poll panel for demanding an affidavit under oath from him to support his claims. Speaking at the 'Vote Adhikar Rally’ in Bengaluru, Gandhi said, \"I have taken the oath inside the Parliament and on the constitution, and EC is asking me to take an oath on the vote theft,” he said. Gandhi also alleged that the EC websites in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Bihar have been shut down because they knew that if people started questioning based on data, then their entire structure would collapse. \"If we get the electronic voter list then we will prove that the prime minister of this country has become the PM by way of theft,” he said. What were Gandhi’s allegations? Gandhi on Thursday made a presentation that he claimed proved there were 100,250 “stolen” votes in the Mahadevapura assembly segment of Bangalore (Central) Parliamentary constituency that helped the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) win the seat in 2024. His presentation also included names of the voters involved, prompting an immediate reaction from the Election Commission, which asked him to send a signed declaration and oath to the effect. “EC was colluding with the BJP to steal elections. In one assembly segment, 100,250-vote theft took place. This is the reason why EC doesn’t give us machine-readable data,” he said. Gandhi had presented the EPIC number of a person named Aditya Srivastava from Lucknow claiming that in addition to Karnataka, he was also a voter in UP. He even displayed his face, photograph, and EPIC number during the presentation. How did the EC react? The chief electoral officers (CEO) of Karnataka, Maharashtra and Haryana said they would initiate the necessary proceedings after Gandhi declares under oath that he believes the wrongful inclusions and exclusions cited by him to be \"true to the best of his knowledge and belief\". \"You are kindly requested to sign and return the enclosed declaration/oath under Rule 20(3)(b) of the Registration of Electors Rules, 1960, along with the name(s) of such elector(s) so that necessary proceedings can be initiated,\" the three CEOs said in separate letters. Can Gandhi be penalised? Under Section 31 of the Representation of People Act, 1950, if a person makes false information regarding preparation, revision or correction of an electoral roll, or the inclusion or exclusion of any entry in or from an electoral roll, \"A statement or declaration in writing which is false and which he either knows or believes to be false or does not believe to be true, he shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine, or with both” Constitutional law expert PDT Achary, however, told The Hindu that these rules do not apply in this situation. These rules apply till 30 days after draft rolls are published. “In this case elections were held 15 months back (Lok Sabha polls 2024) and the Congress party has investigated the entire issue on its own now. These rules have no application whatsoever to the present case,” he said. Former Chief Election Commissioner OP Rawat also told The Hindu that the rule quoted by the EC is more applicable in cases like the Special Intensive Revision of Electoral Rolls, which is currently ongoing in Bihar.",

He accused the BJP of stealing over 1 lakh votes in Bangalore's Mahadevapura Assembly segment during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The EC demanded Gandhi to either sign a formal declaration supporting his claims or apologize publicly. Gandhi refused, insisting on presenting further evidence. The EC warned that failure to comply could result in legal consequences.",
        "ai_content": "In a significant political controversy, Rahul Gandhi, leader of the Indian National Congress and Member of Parliament, may face repercussions following accusations of election fraud against the Election Commission of India (EC). During a rally in Bengaluru, Gandhi asserted that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) engaged in widespread vote tampering, specifically alleging that over 100,000 votes were illicitly transferred within the Mahadevapura Assembly segment in Bangalore Central Parliamentary constituency, contributing to the BJP's victory in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.\nGandhi supported these assertions with what he termed as 'EPIC' evidence, including details about individuals allegedly involved in the fraudulent activities. However, the EC promptly challenged Gandhi's claims, requesting him to substantiate them through a sworn declaration or issue a public apology for spreading unfounded allegations. The EC emphasized its expectation for Gandhi to adhere to due process before accusing such grave misconduct.\nThe Karnataka Chief Electoral Officer reinforced this demand by instructing Gandhi to present his evidence under oath according to specific rules governing elector registration. Despite being given a chance to clarify his position, Gandhi maintained his stance, arguing that his previous oaths in parliament and commitment to constitutional principles necessitated a similar affirmation regarding the EC's integrity.\nGandhi further contended that shutting down EC websites in several states indicated an attempt to suppress scrutiny into voting patterns. He suggested that access to comprehensive electronic voter lists might reveal systemic manipulation leading to unlawful appointments like Prime Minister Narendra Modi's tenure.\nAs tensions escalated between Gandhi and the EC, the latter underscored the gravity of the situation, indicating that non-compliance with their request could lead to serious legal implications. This standoff highlights the delicate balance between political discourse and adherence to established electoral processes.",

        "description": "Rob Bresnahan accused of being insufficiently transparent about purchase",
        "content": "Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Rob Bresnahan, who represents one of the swing state’s poorest congressional districts, has been accused of concealing the fact that he recently bought himself a personal helicopter. NOTUS reports that Bresnahan, 35, has not yet listed his “secret” 2024 Robinson R66 chopper among his financial disclosures , with the model in question retailing for between $1 million and $1.5 million. The site was able to confirm the congressman’s acquisition of the aircraft based on information garnered from Federal Aviation Administration records and commercial flight data. NOTUS adds that Bresnahan, a multimillionaire who recently sold control of his family’s electrical contracting business, acquired the helicopter late last year and has already used it for dozens of flights, some of which have taken him to New York, New Jersey and Rhode Island. While there is nothing illegal about representatives buying personal aircraft, “it’s incumbent on members of Congress to be transparent about these kinds of things,” said Philip Hensley-Robin, executive director of the government watchdog group Common Cause Pennsylvania. “We don’t know if it’s being used for official purposes, campaign purposes – it’s a mystery.” Hannah Pope, the congressman’s spokesperson, told NOTUS: “In emergency situations such as downed power lines or washed-out roads, helicopters play a critical role in inspecting infrastructure and identifying areas in need of urgent repair. “His goal was to work toward a commercial pilot certificate with a rotorcraft-helicopter rating and use the aircraft to provide emergency response and inspection services that help keep seniors warm, hospitals powered, and schools open.” She added, “Since being elected to Congress, those business plans have been put on hold. No taxpayer or campaign funds were used to purchase the aircraft, and no taxpayer or campaign funds are used to store, operate, or maintain the aircraft.” The Independent has also reached out to Rep. Bresnahan for comment. The congressman represents the Keystone State’s 8th District, which ranks second-to-last in median household income, $61,140 as of 2023, according to U.S. Census data . Bresnahan has previously sought to emphasize his everyman credentials, describing a childhood of plowing snow for neighbors and helping out at his parents’ bowling alley and grandparents’ electrical store in addition to completing his studies and participating in high school ice hockey practice. “I will fight to protect working-class families in northeastern Pennsylvania and stand with President Trump in opposing gutting Medicaid ,” he said in a statement in March. “My position on this has not and will not change.” He nevertheless voted for Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which the president signed into law on Independence Day and which threatens to cut welfare for millions of Americans, leading to angry scenes at a Scranton town hall earlier this week organized to draw attention to his “broken vows.” Bresnahan also faced questions in July after allegedly buying shares in defense companies ahead of Trump’s strikes on Iran, despite previously pushing to block lawmakers from trading in stocks.",

        "ai_summary": "Pennsylvania GOP Congressman Rob Bresnahan faces criticism for allegedly failing to disclose the purchase of a private helicopter valued at $1 million to $1.5 million. Despite claims of using it for emergencies like inspections after natural disasters, details remain unclear due to lack of transparency in financial disclosures.",
        "ai_content": "Rob Bresnahan, a member of the United States House of Representatives representing Pennsylvania's 8th Congressional District—one of the state's least affluent regions—has come under fire for reportedly purchasing a personal helicopter while omitting this significant expenditure from his public financial statements. The Robinson R66 helicopter, whose price ranges from $1 million to $1.5 million, remains unlisted among Bresnahan's disclosed assets despite its recent acquisition, raising questions regarding its intended use given the absence of clarity around whether it's employed for official duties or campaign activities. This controversy emerged following revelations obtained through FAA records and flight data analysis conducted by investigative journalists at NOTUS, revealing that Bresnahan utilized the helicopter extensively throughout the previous year, including trips to major cities across several states. Notably, Bresnahan, once a multimillionaire owning a substantial electrical contracting enterprise before divesting his stake, justified the procurement citing potential applications in emergency scenarios involving infrastructure damage assessment post-disasters—a rationale supported by his spokesperson, Hannah Pope. However, she acknowledged that subsequent legislative responsibilities had deferred these initial intentions. Critiques underscore the expectation for congressional officials to exhibit full disclosure concerning their acquisitions, especially when they could potentially intersect with public resources or influence political campaigns. In defense, Bresnahan maintains that neither taxpayer nor campaign finances facilitated the helicopter's purchase or upkeep, suggesting a commitment to fiscal responsibility amidst ongoing scrutiny.",

        "description": "Radical parties are now more numerous than any other category in 31 countries.",
        "content": "In the 2024 UK general election, Reform came third with a 14% share of the vote, capturing five seats in the House of Commons . This was a breakthrough election for the party. In the previous general election in 2019, when it was known as the Brexit party, it won a 2% vote share and captured no parliamentary seats at all. This success is part of a trend. Radical right-wing populist parties are making gains in elections across many democracies and, in plenty of cases, they’re winning power. Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy has been in government in Italy since the election of September 2022, when they took 26% of the vote and captured 119 seats in the national parliament. In the National Assembly elections of June 2024, Marine Le Pen’s National Rally increased its representation from 89 seats to 125 seats. And in the Netherlands, the Freedom Party (PVV), led by right-wing populist Geert Wilders won the largest vote share in 2023 with 24%, capturing 37 seats in the House of Representatives. Perhaps most significantly, Donald Trump won the US presidential election in November 2024 with a rightwing populist agenda – a victory that has created turmoil in American politics and the economy, along with the rest of the world. Expert views The American political scientist, Larry Bartels, argued in a recent book that democracy erodes from the top . He explains that contemporary democracies die not by military coups or revolutionary overthrows but by populist leaders winning elections and then subverting the institutions of democracy from within. Once in power, they restrict the freedom of the courts, squeeze the fairness out of elections and attack the press. The Chapel Hill expert surveys , a database that classifies political parties into ideological groupings, helps illustrate the stakes at play here. The 2024 survey data covers 31 countries and it was administered in all the European Union member states plus a few others including Britain, Norway and Turkey. It shows that there are more radical right-wing parties than any other kind of party in these countries and they are growing in number and in support. The 2024 data was compiled by 609 political scientists, who looked at party ideologies, their policy preferences, electoral performances and the extent to which they participate in government. There are 279 parties in the database altogether and so they are classified into “party families” to make the analysis manageable. A party family is a grouping of parties which the experts think are similar to each other, even though there may be some differences between them. For example, the Alternative for Germany (AfD), the National Rally (RN) in France, the Party for Freedom (VVD) in the Netherlands, the Freedom Party in Austria (FPO) and Reform in Britain are all classified as right-wing populist parties in the dataset. The chart shows the extent to which these 11 party families have been successful in winning votes in the most recent elections. The Performance of Party Families in 31 Countries in 2024: The radical right family consisted of 48 parties, and on average they won 11% of the votes and 17% of seats in the various national legislatures. They are growing in support and influence, coming fourth after the conservative, socialist and Christian democrat party families in voting support and representation in parliaments. The threat to democracy We can get some idea of how likely such parties are to undermine democracy by looking at responses to a question in the Chapel Hill survey. This asked the experts to judge the extent to which parties think power should or should not be concentrated in the executive. It is measured on a ten-point scale where zero means that the party is strongly in favour of constraining the power of the executive, whereas ten means that a party opposes any restrictions on executive powers. The chart shows the average scores for each of the party families on this executive power scale. It is readily apparent that the radical right parties are significant outliers on the scale, being very much more likely to support executive dominance than the other party families. Scores on the Executive Power Scale The survey showed that parties of the right such as the Conservatives, Agrarian and Religious parties are rather more likely to support executive dominance than parties of the centre or left. But the radical right parties stand out as really strongly supporting this. This is in sharp contrast to radical left parties, which are quite suspicious of such executive dominance. This is important since it shows that once in power these parties are tempted to subvert the separation of powers between the executive, the legislature and the judiciary. This is likely to be accompanied by attacks on an independent media, the use of the courts against opponents and attempts to gerrymander elections. All this comes from the belief that a strong leader is the best form of government, a sentiment shared by many Trump supporters in the United States. Anne Applebaum’s recent book Twilight of Democracy illustrates this dynamic in the case of eastern European countries such as Poland and Hungary. The implication is that if these parties grow stronger and dominate governments they are quite likely to try to subvert democracy. Reform supporters in Britain could get more than they bargained for.

Additionally, Donald Trump's re-election in the United States marked another triumph for such movements. Experts like Larry Bartels suggest that these parties undermine democracy through institutional subversion once elected.",
        "ai_content": "The ascent of radical right-wing populist parties poses a substantial challenge to established Western democracies. Recent trends indicate a surge in popularity and influence among these groups, raising concerns about the future of liberal democratic values. In the United Kingdom, the Reform party made history during the 2024 general election by achieving a remarkable 14% vote share and gaining five seats in Parliament—a stark contrast to its negligible presence in the prior 2019 election under the name 'Brexit party.' Similarly, Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy capitalized on Italian voters' sentiments, obtaining a commanding 26% of votes and seizing control of 119 seats in the national parliament after their September 2022 election win.\nFrance witnessed a parallel development as Marine Le Pen's National Rally bolstered its legislative strength, expanding its representation from 89 to 125 seats following the June 2024 National Assembly elections. Across the North Sea, the Dutch Freedom Party (PVV) emerged victorious again under Geert Wilders' leadership, claiming the highest vote percentage ever recorded—24%—and translating this into 37 seats in the House of Representatives.\nPerhaps the most striking example comes from the United States where former President Donald Trump secured his second term in office via a right-wing populist platform. His reelection in November 2024 sent shockwaves throughout global politics and economics due to perceived threats to democratic processes and international stability.\nPolitical analysts warn that these developments may signal deeper issues within modern democracies. According to Larry Bartels, an esteemed American political scientist featured in his latest work, democracy often deteriorates internally rather than succumbing to external forces like military coups. Populist leaders tend to exploit electoral victories to gradually dismantle democratic structures—from curtailing judicial independence to undermining free media—and ultimately concentrate power.\nSupporting this analysis is the Chapel Hill expert survey, encompassing data from 31 nations—including EU members and additional countries such as Britain, Norway, and Turkey—which categorizes political entities based on ideology. Compiled by a team of 609 experts, this comprehensive study reveals an alarming proliferation of radical right-wing factions compared to other types of parties. Their growth trajectory suggests an escalating risk to traditional democratic frameworks worldwide.",

        "ai_summary": "Radical right-wing populist parties have gained significant ground in various Western democracies, threatening democratic norms. In the UK's 2024 general election, Reform secured a notable increase from zero seats in 2019 to five seats with a 14% vote share. Similar trends were observed in Italy, France, and the Netherlands, where parties like Brothers of Italy, National Rally, and Freedom Party saw substantial increases in votes and parliamentary representation. Notably, Donald Trump's re-election in the United States further exemplified the rise of such movements globally.",
        "ai_content": "The ascent of radical right-wing populist parties poses a considerable challenge to established Western democracies. Recent elections highlight this phenomenon, revealing a surge in popularity among voters disenchanted with traditional political structures. In the United Kingdom's 2024 general election, the Reform party made history by securing five seats in Parliament after achieving a 14% share of the vote—a stark contrast to its non-existent presence in the prior 2019 election under the name 'Brexit party.' This marked progress reflects broader global patterns wherein similar parties are gaining traction.\nItaly witnessed a dramatic shift following the September 2022 elections, where Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy garnered 26% of the vote and seized control of 119 seats in the national parliament. Across the Channel, Marine Le Pen's National Rally amplified its influence in France, increasing its seat count from 89 to 125 in the National Assembly elections held in June 2024. Meanwhile, in the Netherlands, Geert Wilders' Freedom Party emerged victorious once again in 2023, claiming the highest vote share ever recorded at 24% and obtaining 37 seats in the House of Representatives.\nThese developments underscore a worrying trend towards authoritarianism disguised as populism. Political scientist Larry Bartels contends that modern democracies often succumb not through overt force but via elected officials undermining institutional integrity post-victory—restricting judicial independence, skewing electoral processes, and stifling media freedoms.\nA comprehensive analysis conducted by 609 experts using the Chapel Hill Expert Surveys database—which categorizes political entities based on ideology—reveals that radical right-wing factions surpass all other groups in terms of prevalence and growth within 31 scrutinized nations. These findings encompass major EU members alongside additional countries like Britain, Norway, and Turkey.\nAs these parties continue to gain momentum, concerns mount regarding their potential impact on democratic principles worldwide. Their ability to resonate with certain voter demographics while simultaneously challenging core tenets of liberal democracy presents complex challenges for policymakers and citizens alike.",

        "content": "Taiwan has often compared itself to being a “shrimp between two whales”. That expression has never been more apt than today with the US and China – which considers Taiwan to be part of its territory – locked in a standoff over the future of the island.At an event I attended some years ago, a Chinese scholar remarked when the issue of the US-China rivalry came up that they believed there was an African saying: “When two elephants are either having a fight, or making love, the grass around them gets trampled.” It was best for everyone, they advised the other attendees, for the two superpowers to have a workmanlike, unexciting relationship rather than take the risk of things getting too friendly or hostile. But whether or not the current period of conflict continues or the US and China magically become more aligned, the challenges facing Taiwan are severe.First off, Taiwan is itself in a period of domestic turbulence. The government of Taiwanese president William Lai Ching-te, leader of the Democratic Progressive party, was elected in January 2024 with a little over 40% of the vote. This was considerably less than his predecessor from the same party, Tsai Ing-wen.One of the main opposition leaders, Ke Wen-je of the Taiwan People’s party, has since then been arrested on corruption charges. He is accused of accepting half a million US dollars in bribes during his term as mayor of Taipei as well as misreporting campaign finances during his presidential run.Most recently, in late July, recall votes were held where citizens in 24 districts of Taiwan chose whether or not to remove their legislator from office. This is the result of a law in Taiwan stipulating a new vote if 10% of the electorate in a specific constituency express dissatisfaction at the previous outcome. Activists supporting the government mobilised to achieve this. The votes seem to be associated with frustration that, while the Democratic Progressive party controls the presidency, it cannot get legislation through a parliament dominated by its opponents. All of the votes were directed at seats held by the Kuomintang, the main opposition party in recent years that is accused by its critics of being pro-China. Not a single seat was overturned. When the steady nationalism of Xi Jinping’s leadership in Beijing is factored in, with its conviction that the global influence of the west is slowly declining and the east – dominated by China – is in the nascent, one can see why the issue of Taiwan might look more precarious and worrying. This is regardless of the various predictions that 2027 is the date that China has set to go for reunification.Ambiguous US positionFor the US, President Donald Trump’s fixation has remained on correcting what he sees as China’s unfair trade advantages with its largest single economic partner – something he has long talked about. The White House proclaimed in March, when the first set of trade negotiations with China concluded after tariffs were imposed by both sides, that: “for too long, unfair trade practices and America’s massive trade deficit with China have fuelled the offshoring of American jobs and the decline of our manufacturing sector.” The aim at the most recent set of talks in Stockholm, Sweden, in late July was to drive towards a new deal. Trump has also reportedly talked of taking a huge delegation of business people to China at some point later in 2025. This is despite the fact that so far since his inauguration in January, and despite many reasons to talk, Xi and Trump have yet to physically meet. Taiwanese people are therefore right to feel increasingly uneasy. Under Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, they received verbal commitments that the US would come to Taiwan’s aid if it was attacked. This was not formal US policy, which has long maintained an ambiguous stance on Taiwan. Ambiguity has returned with a vengeance under Trump. His secretary of defence, Pete Hegseth, has said that the US stands by Taiwan. But these days in Washington all roads lead to the Oval Office, and Trump’s stance is far harder to predict. If China were to dangle a trade deal in front of the US president – committing to buy more US goods, put in more investment that is non-problematic on security grounds in the US and generally abide by American demands – would Trump be able to resist? It could be presented as a historic achievement, a new concordant between the world’s two greatest powers who had seemed until then set on conflict and clash. There might even be the much desired Nobel Peace Prize in it for the US leader. Trump, for his part, appears increasingly reluctant to back Taiwan in ways that risk provoking Beijing. Lai delayed a trip to Latin America in July after the Trump administration reportedly told him to cancel a proposed stopover in New York. And the US cancelled a meeting with Taiwan’s defence minister one month earlier.The likelihood remains that, if a real crisis occurs, then the US will climb down from the middle wall and do something to defend Taiwan. Any trade deal between Beijing and Washington will also probably be a highly circumscribed one. China is not an easy partner to negotiate with, and it is unlikely to offer Trump the kind of capitulation he is seeking. Even so, these are very unpredictable times. The key calculation going forward will be the simple one of what the US gains and loses from all its relationships – and that includes Taiwan.Kerry Brown does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.",

        "ai_content": "As tensions simmer between the United States and China, Taiwan finds itself caught in the crossfire, grappling with internal strife and external pressures. In January 2024, President William Lai Ching-te assumed office representing the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), securing only slightly more than 40% of the popular vote—a stark contrast to his DPP predecessor, Tsai Ing-wen. The political climate within Taiwan remains volatile; one significant development involves Ke Wen-je, former Mayor of Taipei and prominent figure in the Taiwan People's Party (TPP). Accused of taking $500,000 in bribes and falsifying campaign finance reports, Ke Wen-je now confronts legal repercussions following his arrest on corruption charges.\nThe situation further escalated when recall elections took place across 24 districts in late July, allowing voters to decide whether legislators would remain in office based on a newly enacted law requiring such action if 10% of constituents expressed discontentment. These recalls stemmed largely from frustrations regarding the DPP's inability to pass legislation despite holding the presidency—an obstacle attributed to a parliamentary system controlled predominantly by rival parties, notably the Kuomintang (KMT).\nThe KMT, historically seen as pro-China, faced no successful recall attempts, suggesting a complex interplay of local politics beyond simple partisan divides. Meanwhile, the broader geopolitical context looms large, with China's President Xi Jinping fostering a strong nationalist agenda that casts Taiwan as an integral part of its sovereign territory. As these dynamics unfold, Taiwan navigates a delicate balance between asserting its autonomy and managing relationships with global powers.",

Under Taiwanese law, such action requires only 10% voter turnout expressing dissatisfaction; however, activists rallied in support of the government to meet this threshold.

        "content": "Core Thesis Regulators have watched zero‐days‐to‐expiration (0DTE) options explode—now accounting for over 61% of daily SPX volume—while maintaining a blanket ban on binary options for retail investors, despite virtually identical “all‐or‐nothing” economic profiles when expirations are near. This inconsistency undermines both market integrity and the stated goal of protecting retail traders. 1. Risk Equivalence: The ’Digitalization’ of 0DTE Data Point: In June 2025, SPX 0DTE averaged 2.1 million contracts per day, representing 61% of total SPX volume—up from 52% a year earlier (MarketWatch). Real‐World Payoff: A call with minutes to expiry behaves like a step function: either it finishes in the money and pays out (minus premium), or it expires worthless. That’s materially indistinguishable from a cash‐or‐nothing binary option. Retail Use: Roughly 50–60% of these contracts are traded by retail accounts, and only about 4% of that retail flow is even hedged—mirroring the pure‐bet nature regulators condemn in binaries. 2. Economic Efficiency: Binaries Can Lower Hidden Costs Gamma/Vega Elimination: Binaries isolate directional risk without exposing traders to gamma or vega swings, often translating to lower implied costs for a pure “above/below” view. Fee Drag in 0DTE : A recent University of Münster study found that transaction fees accounted for 70% of losses on 0DTE trades, highlighting how friction erodes returns when traders need frequent rebalancing (Investopedia). Structured‐Product Validation: Major banks—including Goldman Sachs and Citi—routinely use listed digital options in Europe and the U.K. to craft capped‐risk payoffs for institutional clients, underlining their legitimacy in sophisticated risk management. 3. Regulatory Inconsistency: OTC Binaries vs. Exchange‐Traded 0DTE Binaries’ Bad Reputation: True, many OTC binary brokers engaged in fraud, especially in unregulated jurisdictions. The U.K. FCA’s 2021 ban on retail binaries was projected to save consumers up to £17 million annually from unexpected losses (The Paypers). 0DTE’s Real‐World Risks: Yet identical economic bets now occur on Cboe and CME—venues with central clearing, transparent quotes, and mandatory market‐maker hedges. If fraud prevention is the goal, why not migrate binaries onto these same infrastructures? Event‐Contract Precedent: The CFTC’s approval of event‐based contracts (e.g., Kalshi’s CPI and election markets) shows regulators can safely list binary‐style products under exchange rules. 4. The “Gambling” Label Masks the True Issue All Speculation Is Gambling: Whether through futures, leveraged ETFs, 0DTE calls, or binaries, retail participants face the same probability of a total loss of premium. Marketing vs. Product: The difference lies in who offers the contract and how it’s sold. Exchange‐listed derivatives offer built‐in transparency and conflict‐of‐interest safeguards that OTC platforms lack. Unified Protections: Instead of arbitrarily banning binaries, regulators should apply FINRA‐style risk disclaimers, ad‐content rules, and suitability requirements to all short‐dated products. Conclusion and Recommendations Approve Exchange‐Listed Binaries on Cboe/CME, subject to the same clearing, reporting, and market‐making rules that govern 0DTE options. Harmonize Short‐Dated Derivative Rules—extend margin, position‐limit, and suitability frameworks equally to 0DTEs and binaries. Focus on Conduct, Not Payoff—mandate clear risk disclosures and ban “easy money” ads across all near‐term instruments. If a 15‐minute SPX option is “legitimate,” a 15‐minute binary is its logical sibling—not its criminal twin. *** Sources: Cboe Global Markets (NYSE: CBOE ), “Retail traders just can’t quit risky zero-day options,” MarketWatch, July 23, 2025 (MarketWatch) University of Münster, “Should You Trade Zero-Day Options?” Investopedia, July 2025 (Investopedia) FCA, “Sale of binary options to retail consumers – permanently banned,” The Paypers, July 2021 (The Paypers)",

        "ai_summary": "Regulators' decision to allow 0DTE options while banning binary options raises questions due to similar risks faced by retail investors. With 0DTE making up over 61% of daily S&P 500 trading volume, concerns arise regarding regulatory consistency and protection against potential financial harm. Studies show high transaction fees contribute significantly to trader losses, yet major institutions utilize structured products based on 0DTE for managing risk effectively.",
        "ai_content": "In the world of finance, where every detail matters, the latest developments around derivatives trading have sparked significant debate among industry experts and regulators alike. At the heart of the discussion lies the contrasting stance taken towards two types of derivative instruments: zero-days-to-expiration (0DTE) options and binary options. While 0DTE options account for more than 61% of daily S&P 500 trading volume as of mid-2025, they remain legal for retail investors, unlike their binary counterparts which face outright bans across various markets.\nThis dichotomy has led to scrutiny concerning the rationale behind such disparate treatment given the striking similarities between the two product classes. Both offer an 'all-or-nothing' payoff structure, particularly pronounced as expiration dates approach—a characteristic that aligns them closely in terms of inherent risk profile.\nA closer look at the numbers reveals that approximately half to sixty percent of 0DTE contracts involve retail participants, echoing the non-hedged betting behavior that regulators aim to curb through prohibitions on binary options. Moreover, research indicates that transaction fees could represent up to 70% of losses incurred during 0DTE transactions, underscoring the impact of operational frictions on investor outcomes.\nDespite these challenges, there exists substantial evidence supporting the utility and acceptance of 0DTE within certain segments of the investment community. Prominent banking institutions leverage these options to construct complex, capped-risk strategies tailored for institutional clientele, thereby affirming their role in advanced portfolio construction and risk mitigation practices.\nThe crux of the issue then pivots to regulatory inconsistencies. Although allegations of misconduct involving offshore binary platforms cannot be ignored—and indeed prompted actions such as the UK's Financial Conduct Authority's ban aimed at safeguarding consumer interests—the argument stands that if fraud prevention were truly paramount, extending oversight mechanisms used for exchange-traded 0DTE options would present a viable solution.\nAs discussions continue amidst evolving market dynamics, one thing remains clear: ensuring fair play and transparency will require ongoing evaluation and potentially recalibrated approaches to regulation.",

        "content": "Texas lawmaker says Abbott's attempt to remove him from office is \"purely insanity\" Texas House member Rep. Gene Wu, a Democrat, called Gov. Greg Abbott’s request asking the state’s Supreme Court to remove him “just purely insanity.” Wu is one of 50 quorum-breaking Democratic House members who left the state to forestall a vote on new congressional maps, and he responded to Abbott’s move on “Anderson Cooper 360.” Watch: Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) asked the state Supreme Court to remove Rep. Gene Wu (D) from office. Wu is one of 50 quorum-breaking Democratic House members who fled the state to forestall a vote on new congressional maps, and he responded to Abbott’s move on AC360. #CNN #News Can Democrats be removed from office for fleeing Texas? What experts say Texas Democrats, who fled the state to forestall a vote on new congressional maps , are facing escalating threats from Republicans, including from Attorney General Ken Paxton who is seeking court rulings to declare their seats vacant if they don’t return. But that statement has “no basis,” said Chad Dunn, a longtime Texas voting rights lawyer and the legal director of UCLA’s Voting Rights Project Paxton would have to prove in court that absent House members did not comply with a duty and demonstrated that they intended to vacate their office. “He has evidence of neither,” Dunn said. “Quorum breaking is enabled in the Texas constitution.” “Quorum breaking is more American than apple pie,” he added. “And no member has indicated an intent to abandon office. They are serving as their people’s representatives with the actions they have taken.” Quinn Yeargain, a state constitutional law expert at Michigan State University College of Law, argued that GOP threats to remove the boycotting Democrats might have more bark than bite. But even if a court concluded that it does have the authority to decide the case, judges would have to consider whether a lawmaker’s decision to leave the state constitutes “abandonment” under the law. “What abandonment would mean in this context is that they went on a cruise around the world and had no desire to return, and therefore missed votes,” Yeargain said. “It cannot possibly apply to a situation where they’re strategically using the power ... to prevent the legislature from meeting and conducting business.” Here's how Texas Republicans want to dismantle Democratic districts The congressional map Texas Republicans hope to enact targets five Democratic-held districts with precision, carefully cutting out blue areas and redistributing them to other districts which are already safe for either party and replacing them with solidly red turf. The map looks likely to perform well for Republicans if the party continues to do as well in the state as they did in 2024, when Trump won by nearly 14 points. However, if a future election looks more like 2020, when Trump’s margin was less than half that, several of these districts could be much more competitive. Here’s a look at the five districts and how Republicans want to redraw them. District 9: Houston would change dramatically under the new map, morphing from a Democratic district based in southern Houston to a Republican district in eastern Harris County. District 32: A big piece of Dallas area would be merged with Democratic 33rd District, while other Democratic areas would be distributed to heavily Republican seats. District 35: The Republican proposal would eliminate the Austin to San Antonio 35th District in its current form. The new 35th would include some Democratic parts of San Antonio, but would stretch out from the city into more Republican turf in Guadalupe, Karnes and Wilson counties. Much of the Austin portion of the district would be absorbed into the 37th District. District 28: The new map cuts out some Democratic areas in San Antonio while adding more Republicans, especially in Live Oak, La Salle and Maverick Counties. The district also gains a portion of Hidalgo County along the Mexican border. District 34: The new map pushes that margin to double digits by excising a portion of Hidalgo County on the Mexican border and replacing it with a portion of Nueces County near Corpus Christi.",

Texas Governor Greg Abbott requested the state's Supreme Court to strip Representative Gene Wu of his seat after he joined other Democrats in leaving the state. The move was criticized by lawyers and experts, arguing that such action lacks legal grounds since 'quorum breaking' is permitted within the Texas Constitution. The controversy highlights ongoing tensions between Republican officials and Democrats regarding redistricting efforts.",
        "ai_content": "In a significant political development, Texas Democrats were given until now to rejoin the state House to ensure legislative proceedings could continue amidst contentious debates over newly proposed congressional districts. Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows announced today's deadline for returning legislators, emphasizing its importance for maintaining a quorum necessary for official business. Amidst these events, Texas Governor Greg Abbott took unprecedented steps against several Democratic lawmakers, including requesting the removal of Representative Gene Wu from office through the state's Supreme Court. This demand followed the departure of 50 Democratic House members who collectively sought to prevent what they perceived as unfair redistricting plans.\nRepresentative Wu described Governor Abbott's request as 'purely insane,' expressing concern over the potential implications for democratic representation. Legal experts weighed in on the matter, with Chad Dunn, a veteran Texas voting rights attorney, dismissing claims that Democrats could be stripped of their offices due to non-attendance alone. He pointed out that proving intentional vacancy of office requires substantial evidence beyond mere absence—a standard which, according to Dunn, has yet to be met.\nThe debate extends into broader discussions about voter suppression and gerrymandering allegations made by Democrats against Republican-led initiatives. Attorney General Ken Paxton has been vocal in pursuing judicial determinations declaring the contested seats vacant unless occupied by returning lawmakers. However, critics argue that such moves may lack substantive legal merit, especially considering the protections afforded by the Texas Constitution concerning quorum requirements.\nLegal scholars like Quinn Yeargain suggest that while there may be theoretical grounds for challenging lawmakers' absences, practical application—particularly defining 'abandonment'—remains complex. Abandonment typically implies a deliberate intention never to resume duties; however, circumstances involving strategic departures during politically charged times complicate straightforward interpretations.\nAs Texans await further developments, the unfolding scenario underscores deep divisions within the state's legislature and raises questions about the future of electoral politics in Texas. With public attention focused sharply on these issues, the outcome will likely influence similar situations across the United States.",

        "description": "Despite slamming free speech and immigration levels in Britain, JD Vance is due to spend his summer holiday here with his family.",
        "content": "JD Vance is due to spend his summer holiday in the UK this year despite issuing six controversial statements about the country in a matter of months. Foreign Secretary David Lammy will host the US vice president at Chevening House in Kent on Friday - a Grade 1 listed mansion with sprawling gardens, a lake, and a maze. The White House confirmed: \"The Vice President and Foreign Secretary will discuss a variety of topics pertaining to the US-UK relationship.\" This comes while Mr Vance holidays in the UK with his family, expected to spend most of their time in the Cotswolds and reportedly visiting Hampton Court Palace. Despite his apparent fondness for holidaying in Britain, the Republican has made a series of inflammatory comments about the country in the months since adopting his role as VP. Less than two months into his tenure, the US VP faced heavy criticism from European nations after he mocked the plan to deploy troops in Ukraine as part of a peacekeeping mission. Mr Vance suggested Britain was \"some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years\", though denied it was a reference to the country once he began facing backlash. He said: \"If you want real security guarantees, if you want to actually ensure that Vladimir Putin does not invade Ukraine again, the very best security guarantee is to give Americans economic upside in the future of Ukraine . \"That is a way better security guarantee than 20,000 troops from some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years.\" Just days before he was formally selected to be Donald Trump 's running mate, Mr Vance called the UK the \"first truly Islamist country that will get a nuclear weapon\". Speaking at the National Conservativism conference, he told attendees: \"I have to beat up on the UK - just one additional thing. I was talking with a friend recently. \"We were talking about one of the big dangers in the world, of course, is nuclear proliferation, though, of course, the Biden administration doesn't care about it. \"And I was talking about what is the first truly Islamist country that will get a nuclear weapon and we were like, maybe it's Iran, maybe Pakistan already kind of counts, and then we sort of finally decided maybe it's actually the UK, since Labour just took over.\" Mr Vance lectured European nations, including the UK, on free speech during remarks before the Munich Security Conference in February. He highlighted the case of Southampton physiotherapist Adam Smith-Connor, who was convicted of breaching a safe zone outside an abortion clinic in Bournemouth by silently praying. The VP said: \"In Britain and across Europe, free speech, I fear, is in retreat. \"A little over two years ago, the British government charged Adam Smith-Connor, a 51-year-old physiotherapist and an army veteran, with the heinous crime of standing 50 metres from an abortion clinic and silently praying for three minutes, not obstructing anyone, not interacting with anyone, just silently praying on his own.\" The Republican slammed European leaders in April for failing to control immigration. He claimed they were putting democracy in danger by failing to take voters' demands for immigration controls seriously. Mr Vance made the comment as he insisted that the US under Donald Trump’ s leadership continued to be an ally of European nations, including the UK. Speaking to the website UnHerd, he said: \"We’re very frustrated – 'we' meaning me, the president, certainly the entire Trump administration – that European populations keep on crying out for more sensible economic and migration policies, and the leaders of Europe keep on going through these elections and keep on offering the European peoples the opposite of what they seem to have voted for. \"The entire democratic project of the West falls apart when the people keep on asking for less migration, and they keep on being rewarded by their leaders with more migration.\" The US VP once again launched into a rant about the UK in March, blaming the sluggish economy on soaring levels of immigration. He blasted Britain along with other \"lazy\" Western countries which he said have relied on imported \"cheap labour\". Mr Vance told a meeting with tech bosses in Washington DC: \"I'd say that if you look at nearly every country, from Canada to the UK, that imports large amounts of cheap labour, you've seen productivity stagnate. \"That's not a total happenstance. I think that the connection is very direct.\" In yet another attack on European free speech and immigration levels, Mr Vance claimed the continent is at risk of \"civilisational suicide\" during an interview on Fox News's Ingraham Angle show. He said \"too many countries\" are \"unable or unwilling\" to control their borders, claiming Europeans' free speech is being limited amid protests against \"things like the border invasion\" which helped get Donald Trump elected. The VP said: \"Yes, the Europeans annoy me sometimes and yes, I disagree with them on certain issues, but we have to remember that is the cradle of western civilisation, the entire idea of Christian civilisation that led to the founding of the United States of America - that was formed in Europe. \"Europe is at risk, I think, of engaging in civilizational suicide. You see them starting to limit the free speech of their own citizens.\"",

        "ai_content": "US Vice President JD Vance is set to enjoy a much-anticipated summer holiday in the United Kingdom alongside his family later this month, even as he continues to stir debate with previous public criticisms directed towards the country's political climate. In contrast to his contentious remarks regarding issues such as free speech and immigration within Britain, Vance's upcoming stay marks a notable juxtaposition against the backdrop of diplomatic engagements ahead.\nForeign Secretary David Lammy will extend hospitality to Vance at Chevening House, a historic residence located in Kent known for its Grade 1 listing status, expansive gardens, picturesque lake, and intricate maze. The White House has announced that conversations between Vance and Lammy will encompass diverse subjects related to the bilateral ties shared by the United States and Great Britain.\nVance's decision to holiday in the UK appears incongruent given his recent track record of sparking international disapproval through his commentary. His critique reached new heights when he derided the idea of deploying American troops to support Ukraine—a move seen as pivotal for maintaining regional stability—by comparing it unfavorably to assistance provided by countries perceived as having been inactive militarily for decades.\nIn another instance prior to being chosen as Donald Trump's vice-presidential candidate, Vance controversially labeled the UK as possibly becoming home to the world's first genuinely Islamist state equipped with nuclear capabilities. These assertions came amid concerns voiced at a national conservative gathering where he discussed global threats posed by nuclear armament expansion, notably suggesting that the UK's potential acquisition could pose significant risks.\nDespite these incendiary declarations, which prompted widespread condemnation particularly across Europe, Vance maintains that his observations do not specifically target Britain. As preparations continue for his sojourn abroad, questions linger concerning how his presence might influence perceptions of transatlantic relations and whether his personal experiences during the trip may temper his previously expressed views.",

You may opt out at any time. ✓ Signed Up Trump Grants Bukele Carte Blanche Nayib Bukele’s concentration of power in El Salvador is a familiar story by now. Since taking office in 2019, the Salvadoran president has suspended due process rights in the name of fighting crime, carrying out mass arrests of people said to be suspected gang members and jailing critics. Still, Bukele’s popularity has remained high, in large part because homicide rates have dropped during his tenure. His legislative majority in 2021 moved to swap out most judges in El Salvador’s top court, which then ruled that Bukele could run for a second term despite a constitutional ban on consecutive reelection. He was reelected last year. On July 31, the legislature took a dramatic step toward potentially prolonging Bukele’s rule, approving a constitutional reform to scrap presidential term limits entirely. The reform also lengthens presidential terms from five to six years and allows candidates to win elections with just a plurality—rather than a majority—of votes, eliminating the need for a runoff. Most democracies around the world have term limits for their presidents. The Latin American countries that have removed them in recent years—Venezuela through a referendum and Nicaragua through the court, both in 2009—became deeply autocratic. When Venezuela held the plebiscite to get rid of term limits, it was criticized by some pro-democracy watchdogs. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), which is part of the Organization of American States (OAS), would eventually issue an opinion saying that abolishing term limits poses a risk to democracy. In recent years, the IACHR has become quick to issue statements of concern after major episodes of democratic backsliding in the region. El Salvador “is going down the same path as Venezuela,” Juanita Goebertus, a director at the Human Rights Watch, posted on social media last week. “It starts with a leader who uses their popularity to concentrate power, and then it finishes in a dictatorship.” The OAS and IACHR have been unusually quiet, however. Member countries’ wariness of antagonizing U.S. President Donald Trump has produced a chilling effect at the OAS, said a senior diplomat familiar with the organization, who spoke to Foreign Policy on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive subject. The Trump administration has relied on Bukele to accept and detain deportees in a notorious megaprison . The White House this week endorsed El Salvador’s reform, calling it “democratically based and constitutionally sound.” In the past, Washington has condemned extended presidential terms in the region. Separately, the Washington Post reported on Wednesday that the U.S. State Department is preparing to sharply reverse its recent criticism of El Salvador’s human rights record in an upcoming report. A draft seen by the Post stated that there are “no credible reports of significant human rights abuses” in the country. The United States funds around half of the OAS and is currently reviewing its support, fueling speculation that Trump might leave the organization entirely. The potential end of U.S. backing for the OAS “is being held over the organization’s head like the sword of Damocles,” the diplomat said. Some OAS member states, such as Canada and Mexico, are also still trying to talk Trump down from tariffs. In addition to the organization’s silence on El Salvador, the OAS has recently held back from denouncing Trump’s threats against Brazil over its prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally. On Wednesday, the OAS issued a declaration voicing its commitment to fight climate change. But a handful of countries held back from co-sponsoring—including Brazil, which is hosting the United Nations’ annual climate conference later this year. Most countries from the hemisphere signed on as co-sponsors. The United States added a footnote to the declaration, calling it “fundamentally flawed” and encouraging the OAS to “focus its time, attention, and resources on matters that all member states can support.” A potential U.S. exit from the OAS doesn’t just worry diplomats from Latin America and the Caribbean. Frank Mora, a former U.S. ambassador to the body, wrote in Americas Quarterly last week that such a move would make “the U.S. deaf to the hemisphere’s conversations and blind to its crises, while inviting others to write the script”—an implicit nod to China. Upcoming Events Tuesday, Aug. 12, to Friday, Aug. 15: Mexico hosts a U.N. conference on the status of women in Latin America and the Caribbean. Sunday, Aug. 17: Bolivia holds general elections. What We’re Following Trade tremors. Heightened U.S. tariffs on Latin American countries are already affecting businesses across the region, with Brazil’s coffee exporters and Mexico’s auto manufacturers warning this past week that prices will rise for U.S. consumers. The president of the Mexican Auto Industry Association said the current 25 percent auto tariff on the country is “unsustainable,” including for U.S. companies that rely on inputs from Mexico. Canadian and Mexican officials held a meeting on Aug. 5 to coordinate trade strategies on Trump’s tariffs. Canada did not receive the same temporary reprieve from levies that Mexico did last week. Meanwhile, Brazilian officials have been studying the possibility of a critical minerals deal with the United States to de-escalate trade and political tensions. But hostilities spiked again after Brazil’s Supreme Court put Bolsonaro under house arrest for violating a social media ban. Trump has called the court’s trial of Bolsonaro on attempted coup charges “a witch hunt.” Assisted death diary. A few countries in Latin America allow medically assisted death in certain cases of terminal or severe illness. But even in those countries, accessing the service can be complicated. A Colombian public health expert raised awareness of those challenges over the past year through a series of newspaper columns that chronicled her own choice of medically assisted death following a cancer diagnosis. In Tatiana Andia’s columns, she “took her country with her,” the New York Times wrote this week. Andia was diagnosed with lung cancer at the age of 43 and wrote publicly about what she would—and would not—accept at the end of her life. She fought past stigma and bureaucracy to make her assisted death plan. Andia eventually wrote in her columns that the process was far more complex than she had imagined. By the time she died in February 2024, writing that she was bowing out “with dignity,” the whole country was following along. Her death was national news. Brazilian soccer player Marta Vieira da Silva celebrates Brazil’s win over Colombia in the women’s Copa América finals in Quito, Ecuador, on Aug. 2. Franklin Jacome/Getty Images Women’s Copa América. Ecuador hosted the women’s version of the South American regional soccer tournament over the past month. It culminated in a final match on Aug. 2 between Colombia and Brazil. The two teams fought to a 4-4 tie, which Brazil won in penalty kicks. Both teams have now earned spots at the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. The final included some of the most dazzling soccer played in the region this year. Brazil’s Marta, at the twilight of her international career, pushed the game to extra time with a late goal in the second half. The tournament also highlighted long-standing pay inequities between men and women’s soccer. The team that won the men’s tournament in 2024 collectively received $16 million ; this year’s women’s champions won $1.5 million. Question of the Week Every women’s Copa América since 2010 has ended with Brazil and Colombia in the top two spots—except for in 2018. Which national team was the runner-up that year? Argentina Chile Ecuador Uruguay Chile never played a final match against winner Brazil because the results of the 2018 tournament were determined by points rather than a playoff game. FP’s Most Read This Week In Focus: COP30 Housing Woes A man walks past an infrastructure project underway for COP30 in Belém, Brazil, on June 16. Carlos Fabal/AFP via Getty Images In three months, Brazil will host this year’s U.N. climate conference. It will be a major test of multilateralism in an era when the Trump administration is trying to tear it down. Right now, however, controversy is swirling around an issue that may appear more logistical: housing. The event will take place in the Amazonian city of Belém, which has a metropolitan area of some 2.5 million people. The U.N. offers a daily stipend of around $150 for negotiators from poorer countries to be housed. But in recent months, the housing on offer—a mix of hotels and private homes—has been scarce and prohibitively expensive for attendees. One so-called “love motel” in Belém, which couples typically rent by the hour and which features suggestive decorations such as giant mirrors near the bed, was listed on a rental site as $570 per night rather than its typical price of $6 per hour. Countries have been urging the Brazilian government to intervene for months. African, Latin American, and small island state negotiators called an emergency meeting last week to consider moving the conference to another city if current prices don’t change. The housing costs in Belém could force them to dramatically shrink their delegations, they said; at its core, the housing issue was about what kind of voices get to be heard at the summit. Last week, Brazilian authorities launched a platform designed to help find housing in Belém at more reasonable rates. Conference attendees observed some price decreases. The U.N. has scheduled a follow-up meeting on the matter next week.",

This decision comes amid growing unease among international observers regarding the consolidation of power within Bukele's administration since he assumed office in 2019. Despite facing accusations of undermining judicial independence and suppressing dissent, Bukele maintains substantial public support, largely attributed to declining homicide rates under his leadership. The Organization of American States' human rights body, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), had previously expressed apprehension about such reforms, drawing parallels between El Salvador's trajectory and that of Venezuela post-term limit abolition. Critics fear that these changes mark a shift away from democratic norms established across many nations.",

        "description": "Millions may soon invest 401(k) savings in crypto and private equity",
        "content": "Millions of Americans saving for retirement through 401(k) accounts could have the option of putting their money in higher-risk private equity and cryptocurrency investments, according to an executive order signed Thursday by President Donald Trump that could give those financial players long-sought access to a pool of funds worth trillions. There is no immediate change in how people invest part of their work earnings. Federal agencies would need to rewrite rules and regulations to allow the expanded choices, and that would take months or more to complete. But once done, employers could offer a broader array of mutual funds and investments to workers, according to the White House. New plans could invest in alternative assets, particularly private equity, cryptocurrencies and real estate. The Republican president's order directs the Labor Department and other agencies to redefine what would be considered a qualified asset under 401(k) retirement rules. Americans' retirement plans are governed by a law known as the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, better known as ERISA . Employers are required by law to offer retirement options that are in the best interest of their employees, not Wall Street. Most retirement plans for Americans are made up of stock and bond investments, and to a much lesser extent, cash and heavily traded commodities such as gold. Trump's move rewards both the $5 trillion private equity industry, which for decades has wanted to compete for a role in retirement plans, and the cryptocurrency industry, whose executives strongly supported Trump’s 2024 campaign as they aimed for more mainstream acceptance among Americans. The price of bitcoin was up 2% on Thursday to $116,542 and has nearly doubled since Trump was elected. Under Democratic President Joe Biden, federal regulators were to treat cryptocurrency investments with “extreme care” because of the extreme volatility of crypto. It is not uncommon for bitcoin, ethereum and other big cryptocurrencies to move up or down 10% in a single day, whereas a 2% or 3% single-day move in the stock market would be considered historic. For cryptocurrency companies, which donated millions to Trump’s campaign as well as his inauguration, one goal was to get their industry qualified under ERISA. Coinbase, one of the largest crypto companies in the United States, was also a major donor toward Trump’s military parade in Washington this summer. Under Trump, the Securities and Exchange Commission dropped its lawsuit against Coinbase, where the Biden administration said crypto should be treated as a security. Crypto is particularly popular among young Americans. While volatile, bitcoin has generally moved upward since it was created by an anonymous programmer nearly 20 years ago. “It was inevitable that bitcoin would make its way into American 401(k)s,” said Cory Klippsten, the CEO of Swan Bitcoin. “As fiduciaries realize bitcoin’s risk-adjusted upside over the long term, we’ll see growing allocations, especially from younger, tech-savvy workers who want hard money, not melting ice cubes.” Private equity firms rely heavily on high-net-worth individuals and state and private pension plans, which have extremely long investment timelines. But having access to Americans' retirement assets would open up a deep pool of cash. Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman has told investors going back to at least 2017 that it was a “dream” of his and the industry to be able to draw upon these retirement assets. Previous administrations, Republican and Democrat, have agreed that private equity investments, which can be riskier, more expensive and less liquid than traditional stock and bond market mutual funds, should not be included in 401(k) plans. The average historic annual return on private equity assets going back to 1990 is roughly 13%, net of fees, according to Cambridge Associates. The S&P 500 index has had an approximate annual return, including dividends, of roughly 10.6% in the same period of time. However, private equity assets tend to be locked up for years, because the companies underlying the assets have to be sold on the private market, making them highly illiquid compared to stocks, which can be sold in a day. “We look forward to working with the Trump Administration on a thoughtful framework that expands access to alternatives for retirement savers, offering Americans more diversification and investment options with appropriate investor guardrails,” said Bryan Corbett, the president and CEO of the Managed Funds Association, which is the trade group for the private equity industry. Even after the regulations are written, it will take time for major retirement plan companies, such as Fidelity, Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, and others, to develop appropriate funds for employers to use. Employers are unlikely to revise their retirement plan options quickly, so it may take several years before crypto and private equity investments become mainstream in an individual’s retirement plan. “While Vanguard has not committed to launching a product for defined contribution plans, Vanguard is dedicated to educating retirement investors to ensure a clear understanding of the opportunities and risks of investing in private assets,” the company said in a statement.",

        "ai_content": "In a significant shift towards investment diversification within U.S. retirement planning, President Donald Trump has authorized new possibilities for individuals contributing to their 401(k) retirement accounts. An executive order recently signed by Mr. Trump paves the way for potential investments in volatile sectors such as private equity and cryptocurrency—a development eagerly anticipated by investors in these fields who seek greater exposure to traditional retirement fund pools valued at trillions of dollars.\nWhile there won't be an instant transformation in individual investment strategies, the directive necessitates comprehensive regulatory revisions across various federal departments. These adjustments aim to broaden the spectrum of permissible mutual funds and securities available to employees, encompassing alternatives like private equity ventures, digital currencies, and property holdings.\nThe initiative aligns with longstanding ambitions harbored by the $5 trillion private equity industry and the burgeoning cryptocurrency sphere—both of which have actively campaigned for legitimacy within established retirement frameworks. Notably, Bitcoin experienced a modest uptick following the announcement, rising approximately 2% to reach $116,542, reflecting investor optimism about its future prospects amidst heightened attention post-election.\nPreviously, during President Joe Biden's tenure, stringent cautionary measures regarding cryptocurrency investments underscored concerns stemming from their notorious price swings—the kind capable of shifting values dramatically within hours. In contrast, Mr. Trump's policy signals a departure from such conservative stances, acknowledging contributions from major crypto firms like Coinbase toward his political campaigns and inaugurations.\nAs the labor department alongside other relevant agencies embarks upon redefining 'qualified assets' per ERISA guidelines, it becomes evident that this pivot represents a substantial recalibration of America's approach to safeguarding retiree wealth while simultaneously accommodating emerging economic frontiers.",

        "ai_content": "In a landmark shift towards diversifying investment options within traditional retirement planning frameworks, President Donald Trump has authorized potential new avenues for individuals contributing to their 401(k) retirement accounts. Through an executive order, he has signaled the possibility of incorporating riskier yet lucrative sectors—namely private equity and cryptocurrency—into the mix of permissible investments for America's working-class savers.\nThe implications of this directive extend into the realm of regulatory reform, necessitating comprehensive updates across various federal departments responsible for overseeing employee benefit programs. While there won't be instant alterations affecting current investors, the groundwork laid out by the administration paves the way for future adjustments that could significantly broaden the spectrum of available investment vehicles offered by employers.\nHistorically dominated by stocks, bonds, and select commodities, U.S. retirement strategies stand at the cusp of transformation. Private equity firms, representing approximately $5 trillion in capital, alongside burgeoning cryptocurrency enterprises—which collectively contributed substantial sums to Trump's electoral endeavors—stand poised to tap into a vast reservoir of individual retirement contributions previously untapped due to stringent legal constraints imposed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).\nUnderpinning this policy pivot is a recognition of the growing appetite amongst younger generations for innovative investment opportunities beyond conventional equities—a sentiment echoed by prominent figures within Trump's circle who championed digital currencies throughout his tenure. As Bitcoin soared by roughly two percent following the announcement, reaching near $117,000, it underscored the volatile yet enticing nature of such assets compared to traditional securities.\nWhile Democrats had advocated for cautious engagement with cryptocurrencies given their notorious price swings, Trump's approach diverges sharply from previous administrations' stances. Notably absent from discussions around this development are concerns regarding investor protection against the backdrop of heightened risks associated with unregulated markets.\nAs the nation anticipates further developments post-election, stakeholders ranging from seasoned financiers to novice investors alike remain watchful. The unfolding narrative promises to reshape perceptions about wealth accumulation and preservation amidst evolving economic landscapes.",

        "description": "Millions may soon invest 401(k) savings in crypto and private equity",
        "content": "WASHINGTON — Millions of Americans saving for retirement through 401(k) accounts could have the option of putting their money in higher-risk private equity and cryptocurrency investments, according to an executive order signed Thursday by President Donald Trump that could give those financial players long-sought access to a pool of funds worth trillions. There is no immediate change in how people invest part of their work earnings. Federal agencies would need to rewrite rules and regulations to allow the expanded choices, and that would take months or more to complete. But once done, employers could offer a broader array of mutual funds and investments to workers, according to the White House. New plans could invest in alternative assets, particularly private equity, cryptocurrencies and real estate. The Republican president's order directs the Labor Department and other agencies to redefine what would be considered a qualified asset under 401(k) retirement rules. Americans' retirement plans are governed by a law known as the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, better known as ERISA . Employers are required by law to offer retirement options that are in the best interest of their employees, not Wall Street. Most retirement plans for Americans are made up of stock and bond investments, and to a much lesser extent, cash and heavily traded commodities such as gold. Trump's move rewards both the $5 trillion private equity industry, which for decades has wanted to compete for a role in retirement plans, and the cryptocurrency industry, whose executives strongly supported Trump’s 2024 campaign as they aimed for more mainstream acceptance among Americans. The price of bitcoin was up 2% on Thursday to $116,542 and has nearly doubled since Trump was elected. Under Democratic President Joe Biden, federal regulators were to treat cryptocurrency investments with “extreme care” because of the extreme volatility of crypto. It is not uncommon for bitcoin, ethereum and other big cryptocurrencies to move up or down 10% in a single day, whereas a 2% or 3% single-day move in the stock market would be considered historic. For cryptocurrency companies, which donated millions to Trump’s campaign as well as his inauguration, one goal was to get their industry qualified under ERISA. Coinbase, one of the largest crypto companies in the United States, was also a major donor toward Trump’s military parade in Washington this summer. Under Trump, the Securities and Exchange Commission dropped its lawsuit against Coinbase, where the Biden administration said crypto should be treated as a security. Crypto is particularly popular among young Americans. While volatile, bitcoin has generally moved upward since it was created by an anonymous programmer nearly 20 years ago. “It was inevitable that bitcoin would make its way into American 401(k)s,” said Cory Klippsten, the CEO of Swan Bitcoin. “As fiduciaries realize bitcoin’s risk-adjusted upside over the long term, we’ll see growing allocations, especially from younger, tech-savvy workers who want hard money, not melting ice cubes.” Private equity firms rely heavily on high-net-worth individuals and state and private pension plans, which have extremely long investment timelines. But having access to Americans' retirement assets would open up a deep pool of cash. Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman has told investors going back to at least 2017 that it was a “dream” of his and the industry to be able to draw upon these retirement assets. Previous administrations, Republican and Democrat, have agreed that private equity investments, which can be riskier, more expensive and less liquid than traditional stock and bond market mutual funds, should not be included in 401(k) plans. The average historic annual return on private equity assets going back to 1990 is roughly 13%, net of fees, according to Cambridge Associates. The S&P 500 index has had an approximate annual return, including dividends, of roughly 10.6% in the same period of time. However, private equity assets tend to be locked up for years, because the companies underlying the assets have to be sold on the private market, making them highly illiquid compared to stocks, which can be sold in a day. “We look forward to working with the Trump Administration on a thoughtful framework that expands access to alternatives for retirement savers, offering Americans more diversification and investment options with appropriate investor guardrails,” said Bryan Corbett, the president and CEO of the Managed Funds Association, which is the trade group for the private equity industry. Even after the regulations are written, it will take time for major retirement plan companies, such as Fidelity, Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, and others, to develop appropriate funds for employers to use. Employers are unlikely to revise their retirement plan options quickly, so it may take several years before crypto and private equity investments become mainstream in an individual’s retirement plan. “While Vanguard has not committed to launching a product for defined contribution plans, Vanguard is dedicated to educating retirement investors to ensure a clear understanding of the opportunities and risks of investing in private assets,” the company said in a statement.",

This decision aims to open these investment avenues after regulatory changes, rewarding industries that support Trump's political campaigns. No immediate impact will occur; however, it signals potential future diversification beyond traditional stocks and bonds.",
        "ai_content": "In a significant policy shift, President Donald Trump has opened the doors for individuals contributing to their retirement via 401(k) plans to consider investing in riskier ventures such as private equity and cryptocurrency. Signed into effect last Thursday, the executive order paves the way for these sectors—valued at billions—to tap into a vast reservoir of American retirement savings. While there won't be an instant transformation in investment strategies, the directive mandates federal agencies to revise existing guidelines within several months, enabling a wider selection of mutual funds and alternative assets including private equity, digital currencies, and real estate.\nThe move comes amidst strong advocacy from the $5 trillion private equity sector and the burgeoning cryptocurrency community, who had lobbied for recognition under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Traditionally, U.S. retirement portfolios consist predominantly of equities and fixed-income securities, with minimal exposure to volatile markets like Bitcoin—a sentiment echoed during former President Joe Biden's tenure when he advised caution towards crypto due to its notorious fluctuations.\nAs the new administration takes shape, it's noteworthy that Trump's recent electoral success saw substantial contributions from major cryptocurrency firms seeking legitimacy under ERISA. With Bitcoin prices surging approximately 100% post-election, there's palpable momentum behind integrating these digital assets into conventional retirement planning frameworks. However, despite the enthusiasm, investors remain cautious given the inherent risks associated with such unproven territories.",

        "description": "Now that her Elon Musk backed lawsuit has been settled, find out why former Mandalorian star Gina Carano was fired by Disney.",
        "content": "1 Why was Gina Carano fired? 2 Other controversies 3 Disney lawsuit backed by Elon Musk 4 Lawsuit reaches settlement Gina Carano, who appeared in The Mandalorian , was fired by Disney in 2021, leading to a highly-publicized lawsuit that was backed by Elon Musk . Now that the legal battle has reached a settlement, here’s everything you need to know about the case. For the uninitiated, Carano first made a name for herself as a mixed martial artist, having competed for Elite Xtreme Combat and Strikeforce between 2006 and 2009. She later transitioned to acting, landing her first major gig in the 2011 movie Haywire. She went on to star in Fast & Furious 6 and Deadpool before securing the role of Cara Dune in The Mandalorian. Carano starred alongside Pedro Pascal in the Disney+ Star Wars series for the first two seasons, which dropped in 2019 and 2020. This all changed the following year when she shared a controversial post on Instagram, with Lucasfilm swiftly announcing that Carano had been dropped . Warning: The following contains content that some readers may find distressing. Why was Gina Carano fired? Ultimately, Carano was fired after she compared the American political climate to the persecution of Jews by their fellow citizens during the Holocaust. “Jews were beaten in the streets, not by Nazi soldiers but by their neighbors... even by children,” she wrote. “Because history is edited, most people today don’t realize that to get to the point where Nazi soldiers could easily round up thousands of Jews, the government first made their own neighbors hate them simply for being Jews. “How is that any different from hating someone for their political views?” Alongside the post, she shared a notorious image of a woman being attacked during the Lviv pogroms. The Lviv pogroms were a series of violent attacks against the Jewish population in the city of Lviv (then part of German-occupied Poland, now in Ukraine) during June and July 1941. They occurred shortly after Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union. Related Blake Lively & Ryan Reynolds’ texts dragged into Justin Baldoni’s It Ends With Us case Over the course of several days, thousands of Jews were beaten, humiliated, and murdered by a combination of Nazi forces and local collaborators. Many victims were paraded through the streets, tortured, and subjected to public abuse before being executed. In February 2021, not long after the post, Lucasfilm dropped Carano from The Mandalorian cast, with a spokesperson for the Disney -owned studio stating, “Gina Carano is not currently employed by Lucasfilm and there are no plans for her to be in the future. “Nevertheless, her social media posts denigrating people based on their cultural and religious identities are abhorrent and unacceptable.” The post itself was deleted, as was another in which she shared a photo of a person with masks covering their face amid the pandemic and wrote, “Meanwhile in California.” Other controversies This wasn’t the first time Carano had sparked controversy with her social media activities. In 2020, she responded to calls for her to include her pronouns online by listing ‘beep/bop/boop’ in her Twitter bio. She followed this up with the tweet: “They’re mad ‘cause I won’t put pronouns in my bio to show my support for trans lives. After months of harassing me in every way. “I decided to put three VERY controversial words in my bio... beep/bop/boop. I’m not against trans lives at all. They need to find less abusive representation.” Shortly before, she had said, “Pedro [Pascal] and I spoke and he helped me understand why people were putting them in their bios. I didn’t know before but I do now. I won’t be putting them in my bio but good for all you who choose to.” In other posts, she mocked government mandates to wear masks during the pandemic and falsely claimed that voter fraud had occurred during the 2020 presidential election. Alongside her firing by Disney, Carano was dropped by the United Talent Agency. Disney lawsuit backed by Elon Musk In February 2024, Carano filed a lawsuit against Lucasfilm over her firing, alleging wrongful dismissal and sex discrimination. She claimed that she was unfairly discriminated against compared to her male co-star, citing Pascal’s 2017 post comparing Donald Trump to Hitler. Carano alleged that she was fired for sharing right-wing sentiments online, and sought a court order that would force the studio to recast her. Disney filed a motion to have the case dismissed, but this was denied. As part of a previous promise made by Elon Musk regarding the defense of people “unfairly treated” for the content they post on X/Twitter, the company assisted Carano by aiding her with legal costs. X’s head of business operations Joe Benarroch said in a statement, “As a sign of X Corp’s commitment to free speech, we’re proud to provide financial support for Gina Carano’s lawsuit, empowering her to seek vindication of her free speech rights on X and the ability to work without bullying, harassment, or discrimination.” A trial was set to go ahead in September 2025 – but it’s since been resolved. Lawsuit reaches settlement On August 8, 2025, both parties filed to dismiss the case, reaching a settlement. The conditions of the settlement – including whether Carano will be rehired or receive monetary damages – aren’t available at the time of writing. The filing states that both sides, “through their undersigned counsel, hereby stipulate that this action and all claims, including all defenses asserted therein, be dismissed with prejudice.” Taking to X/Twitter, Carano wrote , “I have come to an agreement with Disney/Lucasfilm, which I believe is the best outcome for all parties involved. I hope this brings some healing to the force. “I want to extend my deepest, most heartfelt gratitude to Elon Musk, a man I’ve never met, who did this Good Samaritan deed for me in funding my lawsuit. Thank you Mr. Musk and for backing my case and asking for nothing in return.” I have come to an agreement with Disney/Lucasfilm @disney @Lucasfilm which I believe is the best outcome for all parties involved. I hope this brings some healing to the force. I want to extend my deepest most heartfelt gratitude to Elon Musk, @elonmusk a man I’ve never met,... https://t.co/qiAX7W1vgf “I am humbled and grateful to God for His love and grace in this outcome. I’d like to thank you all for your unrelenting support throughout my life and career, you’ve been the heartbeat that has kept my story alive. I hope to make you proud,” she continued. “I am excited to flip the page and move onto the next chapter. My desires remain in the arts, which is where I hope you will join me. Yes, I’m smiling.” For more actor controversies, read about Sydney Sweeney’s American Eagle campaign , why Percy Hynes White was dropped from Wednesday , and why Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni are suing each other .",

Her comments included a comparison to the Holocaust and sharing images related to the Lviv pogroms. A subsequent lawsuit filed with support from Tesla CEO Elon Musk led to a public dispute until it recently concluded in a settlement.",
        "ai_content": "In what became one of Hollywood's most contentious firings, Gina Carano faced termination from Disney in early 2021 due to remarks she posted online that drew comparisons between contemporary U.S. politics and historic instances of anti-Semitic violence. Carano, whose career includes prominent appearances in 'The Mandalorian,' 'Fast & Furious 6,' and 'Deadpool,' sparked outrage within the entertainment industry when she equated current events to those experienced by Jews under Nazi rule, including referencing the Lviv pogroms—a brutal episode of mass violence against Jews in occupied Poland during World War II.\nCarano's provocative statements extended beyond mere commentary; they incited a backlash so severe that Lucasfilm, the parent company behind Star Wars, promptly severed its association with her work. In addition to these incendiary posts, Carano also circulated disturbing imagery depicting acts of aggression reminiscent of wartime atrocities. These actions culminated in a high-profile lawsuit supported by none other than Elon Musk, then CEO of Tesla, challenging Disney's decision to dismiss her.\nAs tensions escalated, discussions around free speech versus corporate responsibility took center stage amidst debates concerning the boundaries of acceptable discourse within the film industry. The ensuing legal battle garnered widespread attention, drawing parallels to past disputes involving freedom of expression and employment practices.\nAfter months of litigation and considerable public scrutiny, the matter came to a close last week with a confidential settlement agreement between Carano and Disney. While specific terms have yet to be disclosed publicly, sources suggest that financial compensation will play a significant role in resolving the conflict. As the dust settles on this chapter of Carano's career, questions linger regarding the implications for future interactions between artists and corporations, particularly in cases where personal beliefs intersect with professional obligations.",

The public was invited to the historic celebration, which included a land acknowledgement, blessing and sermon, a symbolic gift exchange, and traditional Gabrieleno Tongva dances.Related ArticlesTribal health officials work to fill vaccination gaps as measles outbreak spreadsSupreme Court blocks North Dakota redistricting ruling that would gut key part of Voting Rights ActMonterey issues apology to Indigenous families displaced by eminent domain in 1950sTrump threatens to hold up stadium deal if Washington Commanders don’t switch back to former nameNative American teens kayak Klamath River to celebrate removal of dams and return of salmon“This is more than a gift, it’s a recognition of truth, history and healing,” said Gabrieleno Tongva Chief “Redblood” Anthony Morales. Before the ceremony, Morales said it was a special day for the tribe, which has had a long history of involvement with the Presbyterian Church.“This is our tribal headquarters now. We’re very grateful to the Presbyterian Church for correcting the wrong that was imposed on our people,” said Morales, who got married at the church next to the returned land.The land return honors the area’s complex history, built on Indigenous labor. During the late 18th and 19th centuries, Spanish missionaries claimed land originally inhabited by Native people, and used them as enslaved labor to build up churches in the California mission system, according to the state’s Native American Heritage Commission. Around 1771, when Mission San Gabriel was founded by Spanish Franciscans, the Tongva people were conquered, used to build the mission, and were given the name of “Gabrieleño.”Presbyterian Rev. Wendy Tajima gave remarks at the event, framing the transfer as “both a spiritual and political reconciliation.” Leaders say this act highlights a growing movement among faith institutions to confront colonial legacies through tangible restoration.The parcel of land was previously the La Casa de San Gabriel Community Center, founded by local Presbyterian pastor César Lizárraga and his wife Angelita, which served the local Latino community, among others, for nearly 80 years as a mission of the presbytery, officials said.The tribe rented a small office on the land for over 40 years, leaders said.In its original form, the Siban’gna sacred village would have been filled with many Gabrieleno Tongva people together in community, living off the land, helping each other and living in “respect, reciprocity and reverence with Mother Earth,” tribal member and Secretary Kimberly Morales Johnson said.“May we strive for reconciliation and cultivate a harmonious relationship with the land and its original caretakers, promoting justice and equality for all,” a line from the land acknowledgment read.Several hundred attendees joined the August 2 celebration and worship service in a large courtyard. They wandered the area, which includes a campus that houses three buildings. People received white sage bundles and Indigenous prayer knots and for kids, there were interactive activities learning about Tongva history and culture.A large garden of native Californian plants — including elderberry and white sage, used for tribal medicines and cultural practices — is being grown on the land, which was also blessed.Gabrieleno Tongva tribal members performed a traditional canoe and dolphin dance, as well as a bird and clapper song.As the Gabrieleno Tongva Tribal Council’s official headquarters, organizers said, the land will be used for all tribal ceremonies, gatherings, and education opportunities.“Our intention as a tribe is to use this space as a home for now and future generations; a place where we can gather, learn, share,” said tribe community leader Mona Morales Recalde.Tribal leaders first began the process of getting the land back in November 2024, after decades of being involved with the San Gabriel Presbytery. Once they learned the space would be made available, Recalde described the process as “a collaborative effort” between the church and tribe, with church officials being open to the idea of returning the land from the first inquiry.The deed was returned specifically to the Gabrieleno Tongva Tribal Council, officials said. A title transfer was recorded in L.A. County on July 10 of this year, said Rev. Tajima.Returning the property was one step of atonement for the “historic harm” Gabrieleno Tongva people endured, Tajima said; after they were stripped of “ancestral land (and) unjustly deprived.”San Gabriel Mayor Denise Menchaca, San Gabriel Councilmember John Wu, and Rep. Judy Chu (CA-27) were all in attendance for the historic land return.“To see this moment happen is just truly incredible,” Chu said at the event. “It’s impossible to fully appreciate today without acknowledging the painful history that came before it.”Native people like the Tongva endured “displacement, forced labor, and loss of language and land,” she acknowledged. “It’s not just a return of land — it’s a return of dignity, connection and recognition.”Chu and leaders from the San Gabriel Band of Mission Indians also worked together to urge expansion of the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument under the Obama and Biden administrations.L.A. resident Bertha Fraire, who is from the Cherokee Nation, came to the celebration wanting to “witness this historic moment” and support her fellow Native American people. She was honored and proud for the Gabrieleno Tongva council.“It’s very important for us to support one another,” Fraire, 42, said. “Natives acknowledge the land that we stand on always, traditionally paying homage and being grateful for the water, for mother nature, for our elders and their wisdom.”While the Gabrieleno Tongva nation has been recognized by the state and the city of Los Angeles, the tribe has not been officially granted federal recognition as a sovereign nation, and continues that fight, organizers said. This would allow more control over resources and for them to self-govern. The federal government acknowledges the tribe under the Mission Indian Agency, but has not granted federal recognition, according to the tribe.La Puente resident Mason Rico has been connecting with his Indigenous heritage recently and came with his uncle, Jose Gallardo. Both are Gabrieleno Tongva tribe members.“This land going back to us brings me joy because I never knew this could happen,” Rico, 14, said. “It’s a key moment in history that I can grab. I never thought I could learn my history that was taken away from me.”Added Rico, “This is our land, and it shows that just because the White man took it over a long time ago, doesn’t mean we can’t get it back. This shows our history is alive... (not) just another page in the history book. We’re still here.”",

This represents the first time a Californian church has ceded land to an Indigenous tribe, marking a significant step towards healing and reparative justice for historical wrongs.",
        "ai_content": "In a momentous occasion that symbolizes progress toward reconciliation with Native American communities, the Presbytery of San Gabriel has officially handed over a historically significant piece of land to the Gabrieleno Tongva Tribe. The transaction involves approximately half an acre located just under a mile away from the restored Mission San Gabriel Arcángel. This area was previously occupied by a sacred village belonging to the Gabrieleno Tongva people before being repurposed by the church.\nThe land's restitution marks a pioneering instance where a religious institution in California returns territory to an Indigenous group—a gesture described by tribal representatives as 'groundbreaking' and reflective of their commitment to reparative justice. The Presbytery of San Gabriel facilitated this exchange during a ceremony attended by church members, local dignitaries including Congresswoman Judy Chu, and other community stakeholders.\nThe reclaimed plot lies at 203 East Mission Road and forms part of Siban’gna, which translates to 'home' in the language of the Tongva people. The significance of this location extends beyond mere geography; it embodies cultural heritage and spiritual connection for the tribe whose ancestors have long been displaced from these lands.\nAs part of the broader movement acknowledging past injustices against Indigenous populations across North America, this action serves not only as redress but also as an educational opportunity about the rich histories often overlooked within public narratives. The Presbytery of San Gabriel's decision underscores a growing awareness among some Christian denominations regarding their role in colonial legacies and the importance of supporting Indigenous sovereignty and rights.\nThis development comes after years of advocacy by the Gabrieleno Tongva Tribal Council, who have tirelessly worked to reclaim their ancestral territories. Their efforts culminated in this symbolic yet tangible victory—one that reaffirms their enduring presence and resilience despite centuries of adversity.\nWhile this particular case may set a precedent for future interactions between churches and Indigenous tribes, it remains essential that such gestures are accompanied by ongoing dialogue, support, and concrete actions aimed at addressing systemic inequalities faced by native peoples today.",

        "content": "There's little question that President Donald Trump and his MAGA devotees can dish it out. Few things epitomize this populist movement more than its irreverence toward established institutions and its willingness to obliterate traditional standards of civility as it targets political enemies (and erstwhile friends during some internecine squabble). Trump's social-media posts and statements are filled with invective and merciless mocking.Trump's schoolyard taunts rarely are sophisticated, as they frequently zero in on personal appearance. \"He's got the smallest neck I've ever seen. And the biggest head. We call him watermelon head. How can that big fat face stand on a neck that looked like this finger?\" Trump said about Sen. Adam Schiff (D–Calif.). OK, I laughed when he called him \"Adam Schifty Schiff,\" but that's only because it was so childishly stupid. That's its appeal, I suppose.One of Trump's ugliest insults—dating to his first election—was when he mocked a disabled reporter by imitating his hand motions. The Wall Street Journal published a piece called, \"The Art of the Insult.\" We know this is how Trump operates. You can find hundreds of examples with a Google search or on his Truth Social account. Even the official White House account does this—when it's not portraying Trump as a Kim Jong Un-style superhero.It's so very funny. Whenever anyone calls them out on this, Trump defenders act as if they are just so above it all. \"Don't you know the president is just trolling?\" \"Get a sense of humor.\" \"You must be suffering from TDS (Trump Derangement Syndrome).\" Yadda, yadda. In full disclosure, I greatly value humor and have mocked my share of politicians over the years. But I find bullying taunts to be crass and the sign of those displaying low human capital.In politics, I prefer Ronald Reagan's brand of humor, as it was actually funny, incisive, and, well, intelligent. It could be biting: \"A recession is when your neighbor loses his job. A depression is when you lose yours. And recovery is when Jimmy Carter loses his.\" He reportedly penned that one himself. But his humor often was self-deprecating. After getting criticized for his work ethic, Reagan said: \"It's true that hard work never killed anybody, but I figure why take the chance?\"By contrast, the new Republican standard-bearer cannot bear the slightest criticism. Even a ho-hum taunt brings a furious reaction—sometimes followed by a cease-and-desist letter. Trump takes himself very seriously. I've never heard anything from him that's self-deprecating. Yet self-deprecation is a sign not just of intelligence, but of emotional well-being. Only dictators—real or wannabe—and troubled personalities maintain a veneer of perfection. (\"I'm the greatest president ever.\")\"We chose humor as a mechanism through which leaders express their concern for others (vs. the self) because of the potential for humor to be both a weapon to harm others and a tool to build relationships,\" according to 2014 research on humor and leadership. Great leaders use humor—especially the self-deprecating variety—as a tool to elevate organizations (and nations), whereas self-centered ones use it to diminish others. You see the parallels.Recently, a South Park episode shows \"Trump suing the tiny town of South Park when its parents resist 'anti-woke' policies, threatening anyone who isn't sufficiently pro-Trump, and literally getting into bed naked with Satan,\" USA Today gently explained. It also showed Trump with a tiny endowment. The cartoon is the epitome of irreverent humor. Its targets are all over the map. It's not my type of humor, but I chuckle even when it targets my own sacred cows, such as motorcycle riders.Yet a White House that routinely displays viciousness couldn't bear being on the receiving end. It called South Park a \"fourth-rate\" show that is \"hanging on by a thread with uninspired ideas in a desperate attempt for attention.\" MAGA can be remarkably thin-skinned, the dictionary definition of people who can dish it out but can't take it. I'm a stickler for applying standards consistently to both sides of the political spectrum, so I'm flummoxed by this lack of self-awareness.Trump has undertaken a variety of not-so-funny assaults on the media, which, as my Southern California News Group colleague Larry Wilson recently documented, seem designed to quash criticism. Some media outlets have rolled over, but the best response is to keep up the pressure. The South Park producers offered a mock apology for the episode, which seemed like the appropriate response.In democratic societies, the public is free to ridicule its leaders. But you can't stop mockery even in unfree ones. Jokes in the Soviet Union could be amazingly clever, as the jokesters had to navigate a world of informants, secret police and humorless apparatchiks. I'd prefer a little more decorum in our political discourse, but since MAGA won't stop the insults it should get better at taking them.This column was first published in The Orange County Register.The post Mocking Elected Officials Is a Sign of a Healthy Democracy appeared first on Reason.com.",

        "ai_summary": "President Donald Trump and his supporters exhibit a disregard for traditional civility through their use of mocking language against elected officials. This behavior reflects a broader trend within the MAGA movement towards challenging established norms and attacking perceived adversaries. Trump's online presence includes numerous instances of such ridicule, which has been met with defense claims of 'trolling' rather than recognizing it as bullying.",
        "ai_content": "In recent times, there has been growing concern regarding the erosion of civil discourse among certain segments of American society, particularly highlighted by actions taken by President Donald Trump and his followers who identify with the MAGA movement. These individuals demonstrate a notable lack of respect for conventional politeness, instead favoring direct and often scornful attacks on public figures.\nThis phenomenon is characterized by a cavalier attitude towards established protocols of engagement between citizens and their leaders. Trump's approach to communication via social media platforms exemplifies this shift; his tweets and comments regularly contain sharp barbs aimed at opponents, including former allies caught up in internal disputes. His remarks range from playful nicknames to outright derogatory terms designed to belittle others publicly.\nOne striking example involves Senator Adam Schiff, whom Trump referred to disparagingly based on physical attributes—a tactic reminiscent of elementary school teasing. Such jibes extend beyond mere name-calling, occasionally involving mimicry or impersonation intended to humiliate. For instance, Trump once mimicked the gestures of a journalist with disabilities, drawing widespread condemnation yet defended under the guise of humorous provocation.\nDefenders of these tactics argue that they serve as harmless entertainment or even strategic misdirection ('trolling'). However, critics contend that this form of banter signifies deeper issues related to empathy and decorum in democratic dialogue. They point to historical precedents where humor served as a tool for insightful critique rather than derision—for example, Ronald Reagan's witty retorts were lauded for their cleverness and intelligence.\nAs America grapples with these contrasting views on acceptable conduct in political discourse, questions arise about the implications for democracy itself. Can a healthy democracy tolerate such displays of contempt? Or do they signal a troubling decline in mutual respect necessary for constructive debate?\nIn conclusion, while humor remains an integral part of cultural expression, its application in the realm of politics demands careful consideration. The line between lighthearted jest and harmful insult may seem thin, but crossing it too often risks undermining the very foundations upon which respectful governance rests.",

        "description": "The Prime Minister came to power with no idea how to stop the boats, and the people smugglers are taking full advantage.",
        "content": "Keir Starmer is a comically tragic figure, and one I almost feel sorry for. He’s a man who came to power truly believing in the power of the state to fix problems, someone who thought the myriad problems facing Britain were all because of those incompetent and semi-corrupt Tories . Now, just one year in power, plenty of his closest advisers are having to face up to the very real possibility that that was not the case, and that the state is fundamentally broken. The Prime Minister himself is still in denial. I understand why - if he accepted that the civil service, the justice system he used to lead at the CPS, parliament, quangos, and the 20th-century international order were all broken beyond repair, he’d suffer an existential breakdown. For Sir Keir, denial is the only way to keep sane. Migration is the single greatest example of all of this. Labour is yet to accept that the promises they made during last year’s general election will never materialise, because they cannot psychologically face up to the real solutions. Just look at the numbers. This year’s small boat migrant crossings are beginning to make Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson look like hard-line border enforcers. 2022 was the highest year so far for crossings since the crisis began. By July 31 that year, 16,434 migrants had come into Britain on small boats. By July 31 this year, the number surpassed 25,000. The date that number was hit in 2022 was August 28. There’s another crucial fact that the chart doesn’t show - while the number of illegal migrants entering Britain is up 52% this year, the number of illegal migrants entering the EU is down significantly. According to Frontex figures, illegal migration into the EU has fallen 20% in 2025. So this is not merely a problem that Britain is facing as a percentage of a Europe-wide illegal migration crisis. This is a result of Britain now being seen as the softest touch country for illegal migrants on the continent. His policy of returning one migrant to France for every 20-or-so that arrive will be no more effective than the Tories’ doomed Rwanda scheme . It’s a complete drop in the ocean that removes no incentives for risking your life to enter Britain. Why would it? When 19 out of every 20 illegal migrants who arrive here will be given a bed and board in a cosy four-star hotel, £50 pocket money a week, free health and dental care, and can start working for food delivery companies with no repercussions. Oh, and if you happen to sexually assault a woman or girl you’ll likely be let off by a judge on the grounds you ‘don’t understand our cultural expectations’. A third fact is just as stark - Keir Starmer has utterly failed on his one single policy of ‘smashing the gangs’. The Prime Minister believed, with his holier-than-thou CPS prosecutor hat on, that he could introduce a couple of new laws, lock people smugglers up behind bars, and end the cross-Channel trade in human lives. On July 25 I published new findings from Tory Robert Jenrick , who revealed that prosecutions of individuals facilitating small boat crossings fell a whopping 60% during Labour’s first year in power. Just 153 people were prosecuted for aiding illegal entry into Britain, a huge fall from the record high seen under Robert Jenrick’s tenure as immigration minister. Keir Starmer and Yvette Cooper are failing on every level, and every piece of data we have proves it. They can no longer blame the Tories . This is their mess that the next government will have to clean up, and every day that voters see small boats arriving the demand for more radical resets will be. Keir Starmer will not abandon his love of foreign courts, foreign institutions, or belief that the French are friends on this issue. And that’s why he’s doomed to fail.",

In contrast, illegal migration into the European Union has decreased. The report suggests that Starmer's approach may inadvertently signal Britain's leniency towards illegal migrants.",
        "ai_content": "In a stark revelation, a new study casts doubt on the effectiveness of British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's immigration policies amidst escalating small boat arrivals. As the UK's political landscape grapples with unprecedented challenges, the government's efforts appear increasingly inadequate when compared to broader regional trends within the European Union.\nThe crux of the issue lies in the alarming rise of unauthorized entries via maritime routes—a trend that seems impervious to current strategies implemented under Starmer's leadership. Notably, statistics from July 31st reveal a surge past previous records; where once 16,434 individuals arrived illegally aboard small vessels, surpassing 25,000 marks today's count—an increase of nearly 50%.\nThis uptick stands in sharp relief against the backdrop of declining illegal migration across the EU, which according to Frontex reports, saw a reduction of 20% in 2025. Such contrasting figures underscore a critical point: Britain's struggle appears less about managing a continental crisis and more about addressing perceptions shaped by its own policies.\nStarmer's proposed solution—to return one migrant to France for every twenty arriving—is likened unfavorably to former Conservative plans such as the controversial Rwanda initiative. Critics argue that these measures offer little deterrence, especially considering that approximately four-fifths of newcomers receive support upon arrival.\nAs the government faces mounting pressure to stem what some view as a humanitarian obligation turned security concern, questions arise regarding the fundamental assumptions underpinning national approaches to migration control. With public sentiment divided and experts calling for introspection, the future direction of Britain's immigration narrative remains uncertain.",

        "content": "NORMAN, Okla. (KFOR) — A controversial entertainment district project in Norman's Rock Creek district appears to be moving forward after Cleveland County leaders gave the next stop in the process the go-ahead Thursday.The project, funded in part by at least $600 million of the City of Norman's potential sales tax revenue, has seen mixed reaction from the community since a Fall 2024 City Council vote allowing it to move forward. A Norman grassroots organization called Oklahomans For Responsible Economic Development [ORED] petitioned to send the matter to a public vote, garnering well over the thousands of signatures. However, a Cleveland County district court judge threw the petition out after other citizens sued, saying the gist of the petition was insufficient. Opponents of the project filed an appeal to the Oklahoma Supreme Court, which has placed the case on its fast-track docket.The Cleveland County Recreational and Entertainment Facilities Authority previously voted to move forward with an economic development agreement tied to the project. That agreement sets strict guidelines for milestones in the phased planning process, with a new county arena, as an anchor project. The University of Oklahoma also has a vested interest in replacing its basketball/gymnastics arena. The agreement says the arena must be finished and ready to move into by January 2029, a topic that was the focus of discussion at another authority meeting on August 7.Cleveland County leaders approve Norman entertainment district planThe project is also split into phases, with development plans for each requiring approval from the City of Norman and Cleveland County 90 days before work can start. Floyd said the proper steps really need to get moving by October 2025 to avoid any delays.\"We want the court to rule,\" said county representative and attorney David Floyd. \"We don't want to overstep ourselves, but at some point we have to act.\"Floyd stated that in his legal opinion, the Supreme Court appeal didn't grant parties an injunction to delay the legal deadlines of the agreement. Legal representation for ORED has argued that the appeal is the equivalent of an injunction.Norman residents want public vote on arena and entertainment district\"Why would you rush a thing if you don't know if there will be a vote or not?\" asked ORED member Cynthia Rogers. \"Somehow this very long process will be disturbed by three weeks or a couple of weeks, or a month? So, I don't feel like that argument holds water.\"Rogers said she and fellow ORED member Paul Arcaroli attended the less than 10-minute authority meeting on Thursday. The agenda, similar to agendas for other authority meetings, did not give the public the opportunity to weigh in.\"They're saying, eh, the three of us, the four of us know better, and that bothers me,\" said Arcaroli.Thursday's vote didn't include an official draft of a request for the authority to vote on, but Floyd did share contingency plans included in a working copy that address court concerns.\"In the event of an adverse ruling from the Supreme Court, the authority can end the RFQ process, pause it, delay it, do whatever needs to be done until the voters have a chance to weigh in,\" said Floyd.Floyd also said the draft will say there's no liability or costs for the county if bidders have to spend anything out-of-pocket, but voters axe it. That request language hasn't been finalized, but News 4 was told by a county spokesperson there would not be another vote to do so. Any final language will be shared in a public document. News 4 will share those details when they're available.Arcaroli says he doesn't feel like county leaders are listening to their constituents.\"To see our leaders, our elected leaders, effectively just ignore us, that's very disturbing,\" said Arcaroli.",

The University of Oklahoma also seeks to replace its current sports facilities within this timeline.",
        "ai_content": "In a significant step towards realizing Norman's ambitious Rock Creek entertainment district, Cleveland County leaders have given their endorsement to proceed with the project following a contentious period marked by local dissent and judicial challenges. The initiative, backed by substantial financial backing including at least $600 million from the city's anticipated sales tax revenues, aims to transform the area while stirring debate among residents and stakeholders.\nThe controversy began when a Norman grassroots group known as Oklahomans For Responsible Economic Development (ORED) successfully lobbied for a referendum on the proposal, amassing more than thousands of signatures in support. Despite this pushback, a district court judge dismissed the petition due to what he deemed inadequate grounds, prompting opponents to escalate matters to the Oklahoma Supreme Court—a decision now expedited through the state's fast-track docket system.\nCentral to the project's advancement is an economic development agreement ratified by the Cleveland County Recreational and Entertainment Facilities Authority. This contract delineates stringent milestone-based planning stages, positioning the construction of a new county arena—set to open by early 2029—as a pivotal element. Concurrently, the University of Oklahoma stands to benefit significantly from these developments, seeking to modernize its existing basketball and gymnastics venues.\nThe phased approach necessitates prior approvals from both the City of Norman and Cleveland County approximately three months ahead of commencement. County Representative and Attorney David Floyd emphasized the urgency of adhering to established timelines, particularly highlighting the importance of avoiding postponements beyond October 2025. He expressed confidence in the Supreme Court ruling against delaying actions mandated by the agreement.\nAs discussions continue amidst various meetings—including one held on August 7th—the future of Norman's Rock Creek district remains poised between rapid progression under county leadership and ongoing resistance advocating for greater civic engagement.",

        "description": "The Trump administration is doubling to US$50 million a reward for the arrest of Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro, accusing him of being one of the world’s largest narco-traffickers and working with cartels to flood the U.S. with fentanyl-laced cocaine.",
        "content": "MIAMI — The Trump administration is doubling to US$50 million a reward for the arrest of Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro, accusing him of being one of the world’s largest narco-traffickers and working with cartels to flood the U.S. with fentanyl-laced cocaine. “Under President Trump’s leadership, Maduro will not escape justice and he will be held accountable for his despicable crimes,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said Thursday in a video announcing the reward. Maduro was indicted in Manhattan federal court in 2020, during the first Trump presidency, along with several close allies on federal charges of narco-terrorism and conspiracy to import cocaine. At the time, the U.S. offered a $15 million reward for his arrest. That was later raised by the Biden administration to $25 million — the same amount the U.S. offered for the capture of Osama bin Laden following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Despite the big bounty, Maduro remains entrenched after defying the U.S., the European Union and several Latin American governments who condemned his 2024 reelection as a sham and recognized his opponent as Venezuela’s duly elected president. Last month, the Trump administration struck a deal to secure the release of 10 Americans jailed in the capital, Caracas, in exchange for Venezuela getting home scores of migrants deported by the United States to El Salvador under the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. Shortly after, the White House reversed course and allowed U.S. oil producer Chevron to resume drilling in Venezuela after it was previously blocked by U.S. sanctions. Bondi said the Justice Department has seized more than $700 million in assets linked to Maduro, including two private jets, and said nearly 7 tons of seized cocaine had been traced directly to the leftist leader. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil released a statement characterizing the reward as “pathetic” and accusing Bondi of orchestrating a “crude political propaganda operation.” “We’re not surprised, coming from whom it comes from. The same one who promised a nonexistent ‘secret list’ of Epstein and who wallows in scandals for political favours,” Gil said, referring to the backlash Bondi faced after the Justice Department announced last month that a long-rumored “client list” of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein does not exist. “Her show is a joke, a desperate distraction from her own misery.” ___ Joshua Goodman, The Associated Press Associated Press writer Regina Garcia Cano contributed to this report from Mexico City.",

Despite previous rewards set at $15 million and then increased to $25 million by the Biden administration, Maduro continues to hold power amidst international condemnation of his re-election. The Justice Department claims seizure of over $700 million in assets tied to Maduro, including drugs traced to him.",
        "ai_content": "In a significant escalation of its efforts against alleged narcotrafficking activities, the Trump administration has declared a substantial increase in the reward for the apprehension of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. The new offer stands at US$50 million, marking a doubling from earlier incentives aimed at capturing the controversial figure accused of collaborating with global drug cartels to introduce fentanyl-laced cocaine into the United States.\nNicolas Maduro, whose tenure has been marred by accusations of corruption and authoritarian rule, faces serious allegations that extend beyond domestic governance issues. He has been charged internationally for purported involvement in narco-terrorism and conspiracy related to cocaine imports—a charge stemming from indictments issued while Donald Trump served as president.\nAttorney General Pam Bondi highlighted the gravity of these accusations in her announcement, emphasizing that under Trump's directive, 'Maduro will not escape justice.' This sentiment echoes past actions taken by the government; initially offering a $15 million reward which was subsequently elevated to $25 million—mirroring the sum proposed post-9/11 for Osama bin Laden's capture—and now further augmented to combat what officials describe as 'despicable crimes.'\nDespite such high-profile offers, Maduro maintains his grip on power within Venezuela, facing widespread censure from entities like the European Union and various Latin American nations. These critics have denounced his 2024 reelection bid as illegitimate and instead recognize Juan Guaidó as Venezuela's rightful head of state.\nAmidst this backdrop, recent diplomatic maneuvers include a prisoner swap agreement between the U.S. and Venezuela involving ten detained Americans exchanged for numerous Venezuelans repatriated from the United States amid stringent immigration policies implemented during Trump's term. Additionally, there were shifts in policy regarding energy interests, notably allowing Chevron to recommence operations in Venezuela despite prior restrictions due to U.S. sanctions.\nThe Justice Department asserts control over assets exceeding $700 million associated with Maduro—including luxury items like private jets—as well as approximately seven tons of confiscated cocaine directly attributed to him. In contrast, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil dismissed the reward as 'pathetic,' framing it as part of a politically motivated campaign spearheaded by those involved in other unrelated controversies.",

        "content": "Bengaluru (Karnataka) [India], August 8 (ANI): Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge on Friday launched a scathing attack against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), alleging \"vote theft\".Addressing the Congress' 'Vote Adhikar Rally' in Bengaluru's Freedom Park, Mallikarjun Kharge claimed that the party had lost the 2019 General Elections due to 'fake votes'.\"The current government is a government of theft. Modi is making this country cry with bogus votes. I had said this in 2019. In my entire life, I lost in the 2019 elections, I also lost because of bogus votes, which has now come to light,\" Kharge said.Reiterating Rahul Gandhi's \"vote theft\" claim in Mahadevapura in Bengaluru Central, Kharge claimed that the Election Commission works at the behest of PM Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah.He said, \"In the elections held in Bengaluru, a legislative assembly has verified 6,60,000 votes. The last election was a betrayal election. Modi's attempt is that even if people do not vote, Modi and Amit Shah order the Election Commission to decide where to vote less and where to vote more. PM Modi has already intimidated the Congress and other parties and gained a majority.\"He said that the BJP won the Maharashtra and Karnataka Assembly polls and the 2024 Lok Sabha elections illegitimately. \"Earlier in Maharashtra, and in Karnataka, he has continued the same trick. Modi and company did not win the 2024 elections,\" he said.He added that the INDIA bloc MPs will march to the Election Commission's office in Delhi on August 11.INDIA Bloc to March to Election Commission\"This government will not survive, we will make you shunned by the people. Not just to bring them down, we will teach them a lesson; they are ruining our country with bad economic policies. On Monday, all the MPs will walk to the Election Commission and appeal to the Commission in Delhi. We have called a meeting of the INDIA alliance leaders. We should all be united; otherwise, PM Modi would have come to power like this,\" Kharge stated.Recalling Mahatma Gandhi's famous speech during the Quit India Movement, Kharge said, \"Do or die to protect the Constitution.\"The Congress leader said, \"At that time, they did Quit India on August 9. In the same way, we are going to do or die to protect the Constitution. I thank Rahul Gandhi. He is working to create awareness among the people. He is ready for anything. Even though he has 40-50 cases against him, he is continuing his good work.\"Rahul Gandhi Demands Voter DataAddressing the rally, Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, demanded that the EC provide immediately the voter lists and video recordings from the last 10 years.\"BJP's ideology is against the Constitution of India. Every Congress leader and worker will protect it...Election Commission of India should give us the voter lists and video recordings from the last 10 years, immediately,\" Rahul Gandhi said.He said that in yesterday's press conference, he had proved 100 per cent that the Election Commission and the BJP have committed theft of votes. He said that a poll in Karnataka had indicated that the Congress would get 15-16 seats in the last Lok Sabha election.\"According to our polling, we were ahead in 16 seats. But we only won 9 seats, after which we started asking whether we really lost those seats. We sought help from the Election Commission. We asked for the voter list and CCTV footage, but they didn't help us at all. Then they changed the law regarding providing videos,\" he said.\"We have protected the Constitution of India. The voices of Ambedkarji, Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, and Sardar Patel echo in the Constitution of India. Basavana, Narayana Guru and Phule Ji voices echo from it.

        "description": "Bilateral meetings between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his U.S. counterparts were a regular occurrence early in his tenure",
        "content": "Bilateral meetings between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his U.S. counterparts were a regular occurrence early in his tenure. But as tensions mounted between Moscow and the West following the illegal annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and allegations of meddling with the 2016 U.S. elections, those became increasingly less frequent, and their tone appeared less friendly. Here's what to know about past meetings between Russian and U.S. presidents: Putin and Joe Biden met only once while holding the presidency –- in Geneva in June 2021. Russia was amassing troops on the border with Ukraine, where large swaths of land in the east had long been occupied by Moscow-backed forces; Washington repeatedly accused Russia of cyberattacks. The Kremlin was intensifying its domestic crackdown on dissent, jailing opposition leader Alexei Navalny months earlier and harshly suppressing protests demanding his release. Putin and Biden talked for three hours, but no breakthroughs came out of the meeting. The two exchanged expressions of mutual respect, but firmly restated their starkly different views on all of the above. They spoke again via videoconference in December 2021 as tensions heightened over Ukraine. Biden threatened sanctions if Russia invaded Ukraine, and Putin demanded guarantees that Kyiv wouldn’t join NATO –- something Washington and its allies said was a nonstarter. Another phone call between the two came in February 2022, less than two weeks before the full-scale invasion. Then the high-level contacts stopped cold, with no publicly disclosed conversations between Putin and Biden since the invasion. Putin met Trump met six times during the American's first term -– at and on the sidelines of G20 and APEC gatherings — but most famously in Helsinki in July 2018. That's where Trump stood next to Putin and appeared to accept his insistence that Moscow had not interfered with the 2016 U.S. presidential election and openly questioned the firm finding by his own intelligence agencies. His remarks were a stark illustration of Trump’s willingness to upend decades of U.S. foreign policy and rattle Western allies in service of his political concerns. “I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today,” Trump said. “He just said it’s not Russia. I will say this: I don’t see any reason why it would be.” U.S. President Barack Obama met with Putin nine times, and there were 12 more meetings with Dmitry Medvedev, who served as president in 2008-12. Putin became prime minister in a move that allowed him to reset Russia's presidential term limits and run again in 2012. Obama traveled to Russia twice — once to meet Medvedev in 2009 and again for a G20 summit 2013. Medvedev and Putin also traveled to the U.S. Popular Reads Fort Stewart shooting: Sergeant allegedly used personal handgun to shoot 5 soldiers Aug 6, 5:35 PM Trump admin live updates: Vance makes case for redistricting to Indiana Republicans Aug 7, 9:09 PM Mom brought kids to safety before she and husband stabbed to death on trail: Police Jul 31, 4:21 PM Under Medvedev, Moscow and Washington talked of “resetting” Russia-U.S. relations post-Cold War and worked on arms control treaties. U.S. State Secretary Hillary Clinton famously presented a big “reset” button to Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov at a meeting in 2009. One problem: instead of “reset” in Russian, they used another word meaning “overload.” After Putin returned to office in 2012, tensions rose between the two countries. The Kremlin accused the West of interfering with Russian domestic affairs, saying it fomented anti-government protests that rocked Moscow just as Putin sought reelection. The authorities cracked down on dissent and civil society, drawing international condemnation. Obama canceled his visit to Moscow in 2013 after Russia granted asylum to Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor and whistleblower. In 2014, the Kremlin illegally annexed Crimea and threw its weight behind a separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine. The U.S. and its allies responded with crippling sanctions. Relations plummeted to the lowest point since the Cold War. The Kremlin’s 2015 military intervention in Syria to prop up Bashar Assad further complicated ties. Putin and Obama last met in China in September 2016, on the sidelines of a G20 summit, and held talks focused on Ukraine and Syria. Putin and George W. Bush met 28 times during Bush’s two terms. They hosted each other for talks and informal meetings in Russia and the U.S., met regularly on the sidelines of international summits and forums, and boasted of improving ties between onetime rivals. After the first meeting with Putin in 2001, Bush said he “looked the man in the eye” and “found him very straightforward and trustworthy,” getting “a sense of his soul.” In 2002, they signed the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty -– a nuclear arms pact that significantly reduced both countries’ strategic nuclear warhead arsenal. Putin was the first world leader to call Bush after the 9/11 terrorist attack, offering his condolences and support, and welcomed the U.S. military deployment on the territory of Moscow's Central Asian allies for action in Afghanistan. He has called Bush “a decent person and a good friend,” adding that good relations with him helped find a way out of “the most acute and conflict situations.” —— Associated Press writer Yuras Karmanau contributed.",

However, after the 2022 Ukrainian invasion, there has been a cessation of publicized talks between Putin and Biden.",
        "ai_content": "In the realm of international diplomacy, bilateral meetings between leaders often serve as critical platforms for dialogue amidst global challenges. During the initial phase of Vladimir Putin's presidency, he engaged regularly with his American counterparts, reflecting a period marked by relative cooperation despite underlying geopolitical frictions. These encounters included significant events such as the summit between Putin and Barack Obama in New York City in September 2009, which focused on issues like Iran's nuclear program, and the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh in September 2009.\nAs relations soured particularly after Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in March 2014—a move widely condemned internationally—and subsequent accusations regarding electoral interference in the United States, these diplomatic engagements diminished significantly. The frequency and warmth of exchanges waned accordingly.\nThe last recorded face-to-face meeting took place when Vladimir Putin convened with Joe Biden in Geneva in June 2021 amid escalating military build-up along the Ukrainian border. Despite engaging in extensive discourse spanning several hours, neither side reported substantive progress. Their conversation continued through video conference calls later that year, yet it culminated without resolution just days prior to Russia's incursion into Ukraine.\nFormer President Donald Trump also held multiple summits with Putin throughout his administration—six instances being noted—with notable occurrences including the Helsinki Summit in July 2018. This particular engagement drew worldwide attention when Trump seemingly endorsed Putin's assertion denying Russian involvement in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election, challenging established findings from U.S. intelligence services.\nThese historical dialogues underscore the evolving nature of Russo-American ties against a backdrop of shifting power dynamics and divergent national interests. As the world continues to grapple with complex security dilemmas, the legacy of these high-stakes negotiations remains a testament to the intricate dance of diplomacy.",

        "ai_content": "In a significant development within Nigerian politics, Ude Oko Chukwu, the former deputy governor of Abia State, has officially left the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), according to reports. Chukwu, whose tenure included serving as the state's Speaker of the House of Assembly, announced his resignation through a formal letter addressed to the PDP Chairman, expressing that his exit stemmed from deeply personal considerations. Despite the lack of detailed explanation regarding his subsequent political intentions, Chukwu acknowledged the challenging nature of his decision-making process and affirmed that stepping away from the party represented what he believed to be the optimal choice under current circumstances.\nChukwu's resignation comes shortly after he publicly endorsed Governor Alex Otti for another term in office, aligning himself with those advocating for Otti's continued leadership into the 2027 presidential race. This endorsement occurred amidst growing discussions around potential electoral strategies leading up to the upcoming elections.\nThe timing of Chukwu's announcement suggests possible connections between his political maneuvers and broader shifts within the PDP, particularly following recent defections from prominent members like Senator Ben Akpobome. While no explicit link has been established between these developments, they have certainly contributed to heightened scrutiny of internal dynamics within Nigeria's ruling party.\nAs Chukwu prepares to transition beyond his role in Abia State governance, observers remain curious about how his departure might influence local and national political landscapes. With his extensive background in public service and legislative work, Chukwu's impact extends far beyond his individual actions, potentially shaping perceptions and alliances among key stakeholders in Nigeria's vibrant democratic system.",

        "description": "Excluding undocumented immigrants from the census would shrink representation and deepen inequality.",
        "content": "Excluding undocumented immigrants from the census would shrink representation and deepen inequality. Christopher Rhodes Lecturer in Government at Harvard University and lecturer in Social Sciences at Boston University. Do undocumented immigrants count as people? Anyone watching as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents increasingly bypass due process to detain and deport unauthorised immigrants might assume the Trump administration’s answer is a resounding “no”. Now, regardless of deportation policies, the approximately 11 million unauthorised immigrants in the United States could soon disappear, statistically at least, if Republicans have their way. President Trump recently instructed the US Department of Commerce to prepare for a new census that excludes undocumented immigrants. This marks the latest and boldest attempt by Trump and his congressional allies to alter how the census accounts for unauthorised immigrants. Although not explicitly stated, Trump may be trying to push this off-cycle census through ahead of the 2028 presidential election or even before next year’s midterms, which he appears intent on influencing. Assuming Trump was being literal in his social media declaration that “People who are in our Country illegally WILL NOT BE COUNTED IN THE CENSUS,” millions could effectively vanish from the official population count. If this incomplete census were used for congressional apportionment, it would reduce representation in Congress and the Electoral College for states with large numbers of unauthorised immigrants. The immediate partisan impact is unclear. According to the Pew Research Center, if non-citizens had been excluded before the 2020 election, California, Florida and Texas would each have lost one congressional seat and Electoral College vote, while Alabama, Minnesota and Ohio would each have gained one. Political gerrymandering would likely shape who benefits from redistricting. Republicans are already aggressively redrawing maps in states like Texas, with possible retaliatory moves in California and other Democrat-led states. Beyond electoral shifts, the broader goal appears to be marginalising undocumented people and punishing “sanctuary” jurisdictions. This reinforces the Republican narrative that Democrats deliberately tolerate illegal immigration for political gain. Legally, how to count unauthorised immigrants depends on interpreting the Constitution, the framers’ intent and the scope of executive authority in conducting the census. Non-citizens have historically been included in the count, and the Supreme Court has never ruled directly on excluding them. However, with a conservative supermajority on the court, there is a real chance the justices could allow it – either by reinterpreting the Constitution’s language or deferring to the executive branch. Even if Trump fails to push through a new census, his administration could still suppress the count by other means. During his first term, he tried to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. The Census Bureau stopped collecting this data from all respondents in 1950 and removed the question entirely by 2000, instead gathering it through separate surveys such as the American Community Survey. Many feared its return would deter participation from undocumented, and even legal, immigrants, leading to an undercount. The Supreme Court blocked the effort in 2019, citing insufficient justification. But it left the door open to future attempts with more credible rationales. Socially, the question of how to count non-citizens recalls earlier and sometimes shameful practices in the United States. For much of its early history, significant groups were denied full recognition in the political system despite living in the country. The Constitution’s original enumeration formula stated that state populations would be calculated “by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three-fifths of all other Persons.” Slave and free states struck the infamous “three-fifths” compromise, counting enslaved people as three-fifths of a person for congressional and Electoral College apportionment. Meanwhile, “Indians not taxed” were excluded altogether, as most Native Americans were not considered US citizens despite residing within the country’s borders. They were instead seen as members of sovereign nations – such as the Cherokee, Creek or Iroquois – even as their land, rights and dignity were stripped away. Only with the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 were Native Americans granted birthright citizenship and formally included in the population count. These examples show two marginalised non-citizen groups, enslaved Black people and Indigenous Americans, treated in opposite ways: one partially counted, the other excluded. With history offering no clear precedent, today’s debate raises valid questions about how non-citizens, including the undocumented, should be represented. One view holds that because only citizens vote, non-citizens should not affect apportionment. The opposing view argues that excluding undocumented immigrants worsens their vulnerability and denies their very existence, even as government policies directly affect their lives. Unauthorised immigrants both use and support public systems. While they are barred from most federal benefits such as Social Security and Medicare, they still access emergency healthcare, school meal programmes and limited housing support. They also factor into education and policing budgets in the communities where they live. At the federal level, immigration policy disproportionately affects states where undocumented residents make up a larger share of the population. At the state level, policies must be shaped with their presence in mind. For example, California now offers food assistance to all elderly residents regardless of immigration status. Undocumented immigrants also contribute to public finances, paying nearly $100bn annually in federal, state and local taxes. This includes more than $30bn for programmes they largely cannot use, such as Social Security, Medicare and unemployment insurance. In 40 of 50 states, they pay higher state and local tax rates than the wealthiest 1 percent. States’ economic contributions to the federal budget are directly influenced by these residents. It makes sense, therefore, to acknowledge them through accurate enumeration. The Trump administration is instead enforcing a skewed, incomplete and politically motivated interpretation of its constitutional duties regarding census-taking and apportionment. This approach could also affect other debates with far-reaching implications. The Department of Justice is urging the Supreme Court to fast-track a ruling on Trump’s challenge to birthright citizenship. This is another area where the Constitution appears clear. The 14th Amendment affirms that anyone born in the US is a citizen, with few exceptions, such as the children of diplomats. Trump is also seeking to expand the grounds for revoking naturalised citizenship, a penalty currently applied only in rare cases that usually involve fraud. A narrower definition of who “counts” in the census could fuel arguments for a narrower definition of who counts as a citizen. Similarly, a policy of excluding non-citizens could encourage efforts to strip citizenship from naturalised or US-born residents in order to exclude them as well. The presence of millions of undocumented immigrants reflects an immigration system that has failed under both Democratic and Republican administrations. Until meaningful reform is enacted, pretending these individuals do not exist is a misguided, politicised and harmful response to the reality of their lives within US borders, regardless of how they arrived.

With an estimated 11 million unauthorized immigrants residing in the United States, Trump's directive threatens to erase them from statistical records, thereby diminishing their presence in federal representation calculations.\nThe implications of this change extend beyond mere statistics; they touch upon the very fabric of American democracy. By altering the basis for congressional apportionment and the allocation of Electoral College votes, states with substantial populations of undocumented immigrants—such as California, Florida, and Texas—could see reduced political clout. Conversely, states currently losing seats, including Alabama, Minnesota, and Ohio, might experience gains.\nWhile the direct effects on future elections remain uncertain, experts suggest potential impacts on the 2028 presidential race and subsequent midterm contests. The timing suggests strategic considerations aimed at shaping voter demographics favorably for Republicans ahead of critical elections.\nMoreover, this initiative feeds into long-standing Republican rhetoric regarding sanctuary cities and the perceived leniency towards illegal immigration by Democratic administrations. Critics argue that such measures further marginalize vulnerable communities and undermine efforts toward comprehensive immigration reform.\nAs legal challenges mount and public debate intensifies, the true consequences of excluding undocumented immigrants from the census continue to unfold.

        "content": "OSLO, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund will next week announce changes to the handling of its Israeli investments, Finance Minister Jens Stoltenberg said on Friday, ruling out any blanket withdrawal over the war in Gaza.

He did not say what these measures could be, but added that there would not be a wholesale divestment from all Israeli companies. \"If we did that, it would mean we are divesting from them because they are Israeli,\" he said. The review followed local news reports that the fund had built a stake in an Israeli jet engine group, Bet Shemesh Engines Ltd (BSEL) BSEN.TA , opens new tab , which provides services to Israel's armed forces, including the maintenance of fighter jets, creating a political debate in the Nordic country ahead of elections on September 8. On Wednesday, the fund's ethics watchdog, which checks that the fund's investments respect ethical guidelines set by parliament, acknowledged it should have considered Bet Shemesh Engines for possible divestment. Bet Shemesh did not reply to requests for comment. Stoltenberg said that one question being discussed between the finance ministry and the fund was its use of external portfolio managers for some of its holdings. He said Bet Shemesh had been handled by an external manager, which he did not name. The fund said it uses three Israeli external fund managers for some of its holdings in the country. The fund, which owns stakes in 8,700 companies worldwide, held shares in 65 Israeli companies at the end of 2024, valued at $1.95 billion, its records show. It has sold its stakes in an Israeli energy company and a telecoms group in the last year, and its ethics watchdog has said it is reviewing whether to divest holdings in five banks. Pro-Palestinian campaigners have said this is not enough and have called for a country-wide divestment by the fund.

Despite the gravity of the situation, Stoltenberg clarified that a sweeping disinvestment across all Israeli enterprises would not occur; rather, decisions would hinge upon specific circumstances warranting intervention.\nThe impetus behind this introspective audit stems partly from revelations about the fund's investment in Bet Shemesh Engines Ltd—a firm implicated in supplying aviation components to Israel's defense apparatus—sparking considerable discourse among Norwegians particularly given their impending national elections scheduled for September 8th.\nBet Shemesh Engines' involvement came under particular focus when Norway's designated ethics overseer recognized an oversight in failing to scrutinize potential divestment opportunities presented by BSEL. In contrast, Bet Shemesh declined to offer commentary amidst inquiries.\nFurther discussions between the Ministry of Finance and the sovereign wealth fund have revolved around the employment of third-party portfolio managers overseeing certain assets. Notably, Bet Shemesh was managed externally, though details remain undisclosed due to privacy constraints.\nAs of late 2024, the fund maintained ownership interests in approximately 65 Israeli corporations, collectively worth nearly $2 billion according to internal documentation. Recent transactions include divestments from an Israeli energy enterprise and telecommunications conglomerate, alongside deliberations led by the fund's ethics committee considering further withdrawals from banking institutions.\nAmidst these developments, pro-Palestinian activists continue to advocate for more decisive action against entities perceived as complicit in perpetuating regional conflicts.",

        "content": "I got the news last Monday afternoon: a text from Ali, a fellow activist, that simply read: “Awdah </3, Allah y’rahmo” – an Arabic blessing for the dead. I pulled over on the highway, jaw clenched, feeling the world blur in front of me. An hour earlier, I’d seen reports that settlers had invaded Umm al-Khair, Awdah’s village in the southern West Bank. He’d been shot, lost his pulse and was in an ambulance being rushed to the hospital. I knew all of that. But I hadn’t contended with the real possibility that Awdah, my sweet friend with a quick wit and an oversized heart, could die. Awdah, I thought, was simply too alive to die. I first met Awdah in 2019, when we were both 25. I had come to Masafer Yatta , a cluster of West Bank communities under perpetual threat of expulsion, through a network of Jewish solidarity activists, trying to find my footing as a photojournalist in a land steeped in both love and violence. He was already a leader, an English teacher and a prolific storyteller, guiding his community’s resistance to Israel’s attempts to erase it. I learned quickly that Awdah was known across the region for the unique way he built relationships. He was adamant that truly everyone was welcome in Umm al-Khair: diplomats, activists, journalists and friends. He spent uncountable days with them, giving tours and telling heartbreaking stories about his life under Israeli occupation and his unrelenting commitment to fighting for a better world for his three small children. He took these connections seriously. If you came to Umm al-Khair as a guest, Awdah expected you to stay – for tea, then dinner, then the night. And when you finally left, he’d ask with a sly smile: “But my friend, when are you coming back?” I knew these relationships were also strategic – Awdah wanted people around the world to join him in fighting for Umm al-Khair. The village, with only a few hundred residents, is surrounded on three sides by the illegal settlement of Carmel, and every built structure in it is under threat of demolition. With so few resources and limited means to resist the constant pressures of military control, settler violence and threats of displacement, Awdah believed that international attention could help fortify the villagers’ struggle to remain on the land. “Oftentimes, we want to just leave and let the pain go,” he once wrote . “But we know we have to stand in the trauma in the hopes that the story we share will change the minds of those who support the Israeli occupation.” In the winter of 2023, I ran a series of photography workshops for Awdah and his three co-editors of the Humans of Masafer Yatta blog, a project documenting the struggle against the looming expulsion of Palestinians in the region. (Two of them would go on to direct the Oscar-winning No Other Land , which Awdah helped produce.) On the day of our first session, the army had set up a temporary checkpoint at the entrance of the village, blocking people from exiting and delaying our start time by hours. We all felt defeated; I was ready to call it a day – darkness is far from ideal for a photography lesson. Awdah, however, was insistent we carry on. “Friends,” he said (as he always addressed us): “This is what lights are for. We will continue with the lesson.” This past week, I have returned many times to the photos from that first photography lesson, and the memory of Awdah’s persistence that kept us there. Awdah was determined, that day and every day, not to let the army dictate his life. But more than that, this story reminds me of Awdah’s tireless commitment to storytelling. For him, the photography lessons were also part of his stubborn insistence on documenting his reality and sharing it in every way he could. It was an act of faith – not out of naive optimism, but dedication to keep fighting no matter the odds. And he believed , like me, that cameras could “perhaps shed a little bit of light on what actually happens in the darkness of Israel’s military occupation”. It is gut-wrenching that Awdah’s story is reaching the world in the wake of his death. In the days since he was killed, thousands of activists , journalists and elected officials have publicly demanded justice for him and his family. Meanwhile, Yinon Levy, the settler who shot and killed Awdah, remains free. He has since returned to Umm al-Khair with his bulldozer to continue digging into privately owned Palestinian land. After holding Awdah’s body for 10 days, Israeli authorities finally permitted his funeral on Thursday – yet military checkpoints blocked many mourners from attending, and Israel’s high court declined to intervene. On Monday, I stood in the streets of Manhattan, taking pictures as thousands protested against Israel’s violence against the Palestinians, many holding signs that read “Justice for Awdah”. I can only hope the horror of his murder strengthens a collective demand for justice – not only for Awdah, but for all Palestinians living under apartheid, occupation and forced dispossession. May we carry his legacy forward not only by fighting for the destination – freedom, safety, dignity – but by insisting on the path he modeled: one built through relationships, solidarity and love. Awdah, the most determined fighter for Palestinian dignity and the fullness of life – we mourn for you. You will be missed for lifetimes. May your memory be a revolution.

        "description": "In an age of wavering consensus and widening divisions, music reflects the times more than ever. One factor missing from the discussion of this year’s song of the summer? The Donald Trump of it all.",
        "content": "Devon Powers says there is one significant data point no one has considered in the debate around 2025’s Song of the Summer, or rather, why there doesn’t really seem to be one this year: Donald Trump . As media has become less centralized—music streamers replaced radio stations, TikTok killed the music video, and so on—how people consume music, and who they listen to, has become even more fragmented. But today, Trump represents a reawakened avatar of cultural togetherness. He may be the closest thing in our society we have to a monoculture. In the US, he is the one thing a majority of people have all fervently rallied around, be they for or against what he stands for. His influence reaches far beyond the fractured political arena of Washington, DC, Powers says, and he could be having an effect on even the music charts. One of the reasons there is no song of the summer this year “may have to do with Trump in a weird way,” a figure whose shadow looms large and has everything “to do with the changing cultural dominant .” “There was a lot of discussion towards the end of the election season and right after Trump got elected about did country music sort of predict Trump. And I think that there is something to that. There are now more conservative touch points in culture that people can’t really ignore the way that they were before,” she says, mentioning the Paramount+ show Yellowstone , the return of trad wives in pop discourse, and the MAHA movement . “It all fits into that.” But there are also other culminating factors—a perfect storm of circumstances—that have contributed to an unpredictable summer for music. For one, listening habits are again shifting on streaming services like Spotify and SoundCloud, where tastes are growing more eclectic, people are venturing outside their comfort zones, and loyalty to any one genre seems to be a dying trend. The industry is also suffering from what has amounted to an authenticity crisis over creative authorship as streamers are being inundated with AI slop, which has become a genre all its own. Then there’s the Trump of it all, whose domineering influence may represent a new version of monoculture that not even the music industry can evade. Powers, who is a professor of media studies at the University of Michigan and author of On Trend: The Business of Forecasting the Future, says his influence could, in fact, be having an effect on the music charts. She’s not far off either. According to Luminate’s midyear survey on music trends , released last month, more music is being streamed than ever before, but overall growth has slowed globally. In spite of that, Christian music is on the rise. The genre is evolving fast, both in how it’s defined and how it’s discovered. “Traditionally, it existed in a fairly closed ecosystem, with limited distribution, niche promotion channels, and a very specific audience, especially in radio and retail,” says JJ Italiano, head of global music curation and discovery at Spotify. “But as younger, streaming-native listeners have become more dominant, there’s been room for a new wave of Christian and faith-driven artists to explore a broader sound.” While the full MAGA-fication of music is still far off—rap and rock remain the most popular genres in the US by a wide margin—there has been a noticeable tide shift in consumer listening habits overall. Trump isn’t the only reason we don’t have a song of the summer, just the one nobody is talking about, Powers says. Billboard launched its Songs of the Summer chart in 2010, and it entered the zeitgeist in 2012. The phrase itself is a “relatively recent vintage,” Powers says. The title has become a business proposition more than anything, a way of “branding music and our relationship to the summer season.” Currently sitting at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 is “Ordinary” by Alex Warren, a YouTuber and founding member of Hype House, the former collective of Gen Z TikTok stars. The song is a choir-heavy ballad about love that echoes the rising wave of Christian music. But where Carly Rae Jepsen’s “Call Me Maybe” and Wizkid’s “Essence” once defined the breezy, irresistible atmospheres of summers past, “Ordinary” is not necessarily what you’d consider song of the summer material. Songs like Warren’s, despite their chart dominance, don’t really capture the spirit of the season. It’s a change that may forecast the future of the industry. “It’s harder to find cultural consensus overall,” says Dan Charnas, associate professor at New York University and author of The Big Payback: The History of the Business of Hip-Hop . Summer isn’t as vital to the actual business model of the music industry as summer movies have been to the film industry, he says, which may explain why record labels aren’t necessarily jockeying for chart dominance in the same way they do in the fall. “Which doesn’t mean it’s impossible. Last year, Sabrina Carpenter defied the odds and created some seemingly ubiquitous musical moments. But convergence around one song is much harder in the streaming era when everyone is pretty much programming their own playlist.” That could be natural evolution. Today, streaming accounts for 92 percent of all music consumption in the US. Evolutions are the only guarantee in music, and “the idea of a single ‘mainstream’ is expanding,” says Wyatt Marshall, senior director of music intelligence at SoundCloud. He believes listeners are becoming more “genre-agnostic.” You’ve probably noticed some of that too. Despite a string of chart-worthy summer releases from acts as varied as HAIM, Burna Boy, Lorde, The Clipse—and even a surprise drop from Tyler, the Creator—listeners haven’t been able to reach a unified accord. Some of that is due to ongoing genre fermentation, which has become a new constant. AI slop , for example, is overwhelming streamers, flooding platforms with bizarre song titles like “Make Love to My Shitter” and “Grant Me Rectal Delight,” mirroring the sounds of jazz and doo-wap with a terrifying proficiency. AI-generated bands like Velvet Sundown , which surpassed 1 million streams on Spotify, are finding substantial audiences online even as they raise legitimate questions about creative authorship. In June, an AI song landed on the US charts for the first time, reaching No. 44 on the TikTok Viral 50. The new genre of sound is posing questions over authenticity and authorship. SoundCloud’s Marshall says he has also noticed a subtle shift in listening behavior. According to data the company shared with WIRED, only 43 percent of plays in the US have been to tracks released in the past 18 months—slightly down from the two previous summers. “It suggests listeners may be revisiting favorites or balancing discovery with nostalgia a bit more this summer,” which may also explain “recession pop,” the current resurgence of pop songs from the late 2000s. TikTok and Instagram have been a huge factor in lasting relevance, or reigniting old favorites, as viral sounds help create long-term staying power. Before 2020, no tracks spent more than 40 weeks in the top 10 of Billboard’s Hot 100 chart. Then the pandemic forced everyone inside and on TikTok. According to The Wall Street Journal, eight songs have since cleared that 40-week benchmark, including “Levitating,” by Dua Lipa, and “Lose Control,” by Teddy Swims. One reason there may seem like there is less consensus this summer is because what’s actually happening is a “backlash to the last few summers,” Powers says. The explosion of social media in the 2010s and the rise of streaming—large cultural shifts that reengineered how people communicate, share, create, and come together—killed monoculture. That was the argument. But “those theories are incomplete,” Powers says. Last year was all about the neon punk spirit of Charli XCX’s Brat . Before that was Barbenheimer, 2023’s joint box-office push behind summer blockbusters Barbie and Oppenheimer . Both were major marketing campaigns that “undercut the fragmentation argument because people will say, ‘Oh, we weren't fragmented last summer.’ No, we were super fragmented last summer. All the same technologies that existed then exist now. Maybe we were a little less focused on AI, but we had that moment of togetherness.” She says young people may have lost some faith in larger music movements tied to political campaigns, like Brat Summer, and be in search of something new this year. In an age where mass consensus is dying out and divisions seem to be growing, fandoms ebb and flow, and often new genres, or even ones once relegated to niche audiences, grow in popularity. “Genres are more porous than ever,” Marshall says. “Listeners are more omnivorous, and fandom isn’t siloed to one style of music.” On Spotify, Italiano says country music is also on the rise, which is finding a wider base. It is “indicative of a younger generation being far more open to listening to music across a variety of genres as well as the constraints around what is considered country music continuing to fall away.” “It’s not a complete changing of the cultural guard,” Powers says. “But I think that we’re still figuring out how to talk about this cultural moment.”",

        "ai_summary": "In 2025, there's been no definitive 'Song of the Summer' due to societal fragmentation and Trump's pervasive influence. Music consumption patterns have shifted toward eclecticism on platforms like Spotify, while concerns over artistic integrity rise amid AI-generated content. These changes reflect broader cultural dynamics potentially influenced by Trump's unifying yet divisive presence.",
        "ai_content": "As the world grapples with division and uncertainty, it's challenging to pinpoint a single musical hit that encapsulates the zeitgeist of 2025's summer. Amidst these turbulent times, one element conspicuously absent from discussions about the year's most popular track is none other than former President Donald Trump. According to Devon Powers, a media studies professor, Trump's omnipresence might explain the lack of a unified musical anthem this year.\nThe landscape of music consumption has dramatically transformed since the days when radio stations dominated airwaves and music videos ruled television screens. Today, platforms such as TikTok and various music streaming services have decentralized how audiences discover and engage with music, leading to increasingly diverse listening habits. This shift away from traditional genres suggests that identifying a singular 'Song of the Summer' becomes nearly impossible amidst the cacophony of emerging trends.\nTrump's role in shaping contemporary culture cannot be overlooked. Despite his polarizing persona, he inadvertently fosters a sense of unity among many Americans, whether through support or opposition. His impact extends well beyond politics; he's woven himself into the fabric of American life, influencing public opinion across different spheres—including entertainment.\nPowers notes that post-election conversations often speculated whether country music had foreshadowed Trump's ascent to power. While some argue that certain cultural phenomena, such as the popularity of shows like 'Yellowstone,' the resurgence of traditional values in fashion, and movements advocating for male privilege ('MAHA'), align with Trump's ideology, others see them as mere coincidences.\nHowever, several converging forces contribute to the unpredictability of today's music scene. Streaming giants like Spotify and SoundCloud encourage listeners to explore unfamiliar territories, breaking down barriers between genres and fostering a more inclusive approach to music discovery. Simultaneously, artists face challenges related to maintaining authenticity in an era saturated with artificial intelligence-generated content.\nIn essence, Trump's enduring legacy continues to shape America's collective consciousness, creating ripples throughout every aspect of society, including the arts. As the nation navigates through complex social currents, finding harmony within discord remains an elusive quest.",

        "description": "A four-hour wait to shut off power to a burning utility pole was one of the last straws for Slayton.",
        "content": "SLAYTON, Minn. — Fire Chief Chris LeTendre said he felt helpless watching the top of a utility pole burn, dropping embers near an apartment complex. Dousing the pole meant risking electrocution, so he sprayed the ground with water and waited for Xcel Energy to arrive to cut the power. That took more than four hours. In the meantime, the burning pole shorted the system and knocked out power for the town’s entire west side, he said. The utility pole debacle is among the reasons Slayton wants to kick Xcel out of its city and form a new government-run electric provider. It is an extraordinary step and one driven by frustration with Xcel’s everyday service and emergency response. Many in the town of 2,000 people feel they were left behind, stuck with crumbling infrastructure compared to Xcel’s bigger cities, and far away from help. If Slayton succeeds, it would be the first in Minnesota, and unusual around the country. A few large, wealthy and politically progressive cities such as Minneapolis and Boulder, Colo. have explored creating a municipal utility in hope of speeding the use of renewable energy. In the face of Xcel’s opposition and the cost of that change, those two cities failed. Slayton’s fate now rests with state utility regulators, who will weigh in on a critical disagreement: how much it should cost the city to oust its power company. Xcel tried to convince the city it’s worth sticking by their side, and spent millions to improve its local infrastructure amid the dispute. In a statement, Xcel spokesman Kevin Coss said the company respects Slayton’s right to municipalize. “It’s our mission to serve our customers well and work to meet the needs of communities big and small,” he said. John Marshall, Xcel’s regional vice president in charge of community relations, told a crowd in Slayton last year: “We do very much want to continue being your electric provider.” Service complaints lead to frustration Slayton first considered splitting with Xcel in 2021. LeTendre described four safety incidents, starting in 2018. After a tornado in 2019, the fire department responded to a downed power line in neighboring Hadley that had “energized” a tree, LeTendre said. “It looks like a Christmas tree because it’s flickering and on fire,” LeTendre said. “None of which we can do anything about.” The tree burned for nine hours before a fuse tripped and killed the power, he said. The fire went out. Firefighters never saw Xcel on the scene, he said. At one public hearing last year, a city consultant said data show Slayton in 2022 had nearly twice as many outages compared to the state average, that they lasted longer, and that Xcel’s response time to outages was almost twice as long for Slayton as the state average. “It did not start at all with ‘We’re paying too much money,’” city administrator Josh Malchow said in an interview. Coss said Slayton’s data interpretation is misleading. Xcel data shows the city’s outage time for the average customer is longer in some years and shorter in others. Slayton is below the average for southern Minnesota but above the state average over the last decade. Coss said the incidents highlighted by the fire department were “select examples,” some of which “show there were opportunities for enhanced service” from Xcel. Minnesota law allows cities to start their own municipal utilities after a city-wide referendum. Then, cities must buy all the infrastructure, like utility poles and power lines, of the provider they are removing. The PUC will also have to consider the cost of Xcel’s lost revenue. Xcel’s early estimate was about $20 million, though Coss said the company won’t disclose its latest number because of confidential negotiations. Slayton argues the total value is less than $7 million. Slayton tries what others failed A disagreement over price is part of what sank the hopes of other cities that explored starting municipal utilities. When Minneapolis considered buying Xcel’s infrastructure in 2013, Xcel said it would move its downtown headquarters as a result. The city quickly gave up. Boulder tried for a decade to ditch Xcel and create a city-run electric provider. Bob Yates, a city councilman there from 2015 until 2023, said Xcel and state utility regulators resisted the effort. Boulder spent $30 million on attorneys, accountants, engineering plans and the Colorado regulatory process, Yates said. He said Xcel said it would cost much more for Boulder to buy their infrastructure than the city anticipated. Boulder also would have had to pay for operating a new utility, which includes employees, service trucks and a network operations center. “The longer it went on, the more people realized that while it might be nice to go greener faster, it was just going to be tremendously expensive,” Yates said. Slayton wins a campaign to ditch Xcel Malchow said they will drop the fight if replacing Xcel means higher property taxes or electric bills. The city plans to contract with Nobles Cooperative Electric, a nonprofit serving the area outside of Slayton, to handle operations and maintenance. That could save Slayton from many of the troubles Boulder ran into. City officials believe their plan would lead to lower bills, if the purchase price is low enough. Before a May 2024 public referendum, the city held a series of public hearings where Slayton, Xcel and the Nobles co-op wooed voters as if campaigning for office. Adam Tromblay, general manager at Nobles, focused on service during a hearing shortly before the vote, saying the nonprofit has five linemen that live in Slayton. “You have a squirrel outage and it’s a two-hour deal because [Xcel is] coming from Mankato, you’re coming from Sioux Falls,” Tromblay said. “We’re coming from our shop here three minutes up the road.” During a January meeting, Tromblay talked about how many children of Nobles’ employees attend local schools and highlighted community charity programs like raising money for winter coats or sponsoring the rib fest at the county fair. Xcel’s Marshall said the company has the ability to gather huge amounts of people and resources to respond to storms. Marshall said Xcel’s $20 million estimate was not a scare tactic. Brad Sylliaasen, director of design and construction at Xcel, said the company spent “many millions of dollars” on the southwestern Minnesota transmission system. Xcel says it replaced more than 200 poles in the last two years and that reliability is at more than 99% in Slayton. The evidence of that long-planned work is visible in Slayton, where the brown wood of new poles along city streets contrast with older gray ones. Some older poles are marked with a large white ‘X’ for removal. Coss said Xcel has a district representative in Slayton and provides crews for much of the rest of the area’s work from a service center in Pipestone. They don’t send teams from Mankato, he said. Malchow said Xcel’s system is more reliable now, but response to customers is still slow. For example, Slayton Council Member Blake Heronimus said the county Cattlemen’s Association waited an “unreasonable” amount of time for Xcel to hook up their new building on the county fairgrounds ahead of the fair next week. Nearly 75% of the 409 people who voted in Slayton backed the city’s plan, which includes borrowing up to $7 million. The city would pay back those bonds with revenue from electric bills. Malchow said the main divide between Xcel and Slayton has been whether the city has to pay for the company’s lost revenue, and if so, how expensive that should be. If the PUC decides the final price is out of Slayton’s budget, the city can walk away, but not for free. Malchow said they have spent more than $215,000 in federal COVID-19 relief dollars and local tax dollars to pay for city time, attorneys’ fees, the election and consultant costs. “I don’t see a time when we stop,” said Heronimus, the councilman. “When you get into something like this that feels very much like the right thing to do, there’s no reason to quit.”",

This event has fueled residents' desire for independence due to perceived neglect and outdated infrastructure. State regulators will decide if it's financially viable for Slayton to sever ties with Xcel, despite the company's efforts to maintain good relations and invest in local improvements.",
        "ai_content": "In the small town of Slayton, Minnesota, officials are considering a bold move to establish themselves as the first municipality in the state to operate independently from Xcel Energy. The decision comes after repeated frustrations with the utility giant, including a notable incident involving a burning utility pole that led to extended blackouts across the town's west side.\nFire Chief Chris LeTendre recounted his experience when he watched flames erupt from a utility pole while nearby residents faced potential danger. With no immediate way to safely extinguish the blaze—dousing it could result in electrocution—the chief resorted to dousing the area below with water until Xcel arrived to disconnect the power supply. This incident occurred amidst other service-related grievances that prompted Slayton's consideration of breaking free from Xcel's control back in 2021.\nThe town's dissatisfaction stems from what many perceive as inadequate attention given to Slayton's aging electrical grid, especially when contrasted with larger urban centers served by Xcel. The push for municipalization aligns with broader trends seen in some U.S. cities seeking greater autonomy over utilities to promote sustainable practices; however, these initiatives often encounter significant financial hurdles.\nXcel Energy acknowledges Slayton's aspirations through statements expressing respect for the city's rights and emphasizing their commitment to serving customer needs effectively. Despite substantial investments aimed at enhancing local infrastructure, the debate remains centered on whether the costs associated with establishing an independent entity outweigh the benefits.\nAs Slayton stands before regulatory authorities, the outcome hinges not only on public sentiment but also on economic considerations. Should Slayton succeed against odds similar to those faced by Minneapolis and Boulder, Colorado, it may set a precedent for municipalities nationwide looking to take control of their energy futures.",

        "description": "Secret talks with Belarusian strongman Alexander Lukashenko show the risks of Trump's latest diplomatic gambit with Putin",
        "content": "In arranging an interview with a head of state, the journalist typically makes the first move, sending a request to the press office and hoping somebody responds. Once in a while, when a president really wants to talk, the invitation might go in the other direction. But rarely have the overtures been as persistent as the ones that reached me this spring from the allies of Alexander Lukashenko, the dictator of Belarus. [time-brightcove not-tgx=”true”]It was not immediately clear what the intermediaries wanted. I had never been to Belarus or written much about it, though my coverage of its neighbors, Russia and Ukraine, had given me a grasp of Lukashenko’s story. In Europe he holds the dubious honor of clinging to power longer than any other sitting leader by far, an astonishing 31 years without pause, which means most of the nine million people in his landlocked country have never known another ruler in their adult lives. His regime is also among the most repressive and isolated in the world, with terrible relations and almost no trade with four out of its five neighbors, and a near-total dependence on the fifth: Russia. In the memorable words of one expert on the region’s politics, Belarus functions as a “Russian balcony” overlooking Europe, a quaint metaphor that elides the way Russia has used this vantage to lob bombs, position nukes, and launch invasions. Since 2022, Russia’s attempt to conquer Ukraine has relied on Belarus as a staging ground, a training base, and a source of supplies and ammunition. Lukashenko has avoided sending his own troops to fight in that war. But Ukraine, like most of Europe, still sees him as an accomplice to Vladimir Putin in the worst act of aggression the continent has seen in 80 years.So it was not an obvious decision for me to take a call in May from an official with Lukashenko’s government, who seemed a little out of practice in dealing with the Western media. A few minutes into our conversation, the official asked how much it would cost to arrange an interview with TIME, and he sounded perplexed to learn that the process could not involve any kind of bribe. “Just checking,” he said, “so we avoid any misunderstandings later on.” After a few more calls and messages, we agreed on the terms of an interview; it would take place in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, with no questions or topics left off the table. Only later, after several conversations with U.S. and European diplomats, did Lukashenko’s motives come into focus. Since the beginning of this year, the autocrat has pursued a confidential dialogue with the Trump administration, offering his services as a kind of Putin whisperer. He coached U.S. officials on how to keep talks with the Kremlin on track, and he gave them assurances that the Russians were ready to negotiate in good faith even as they continued their bombing raids against Ukraine. Using every available avenue to Washington, Lukashenko dangled the prospect of peace in a way designed to get the attention of President Donald Trump: “If we make this deal,” he told his U.S. interlocutors, “they will bring you the Nobel Peace Prize on a platter.”The Americans played along. Within a month of Trump’s inauguration in January, U.S. officials made the first of at least five visits to Minsk to explore what Lukashenko could achieve. In the process, they eased the image of Belarus as a pariah state, won the release of several high-profile political prisoners, and opened a quiet backchannel to the Kremlin through Minsk. In this context, Lukashenko’s desire for an interview with TIME made sense. What remained less clear to me was whether he is a peace broker acting on his own initiative, or a puppet in the hands of the Kremlin. The Americans also had their doubts. “We’re not naive,” says John Coale, a former attorney to Trump who has met with Lukashenko on behalf of the U.S. government several times this year. “He’s friends with Putin. They talk regularly,” Coale told me. “And he has offered to give Putin messages from us. That’s a channel, okay? That’s very valuable.” The Americans have used that channel, he added, to push the idea of a summit between Putin and Trump. They hoped it would help break the impasse in the peace process by allowing Trump to reason with Putin face to face. As Coale put it, using a common nickname for Lukashenko, “A meeting has always been pushed to Luka to tell Putin.” For much of the spring and summer, the effort sputtered and tensions rose. Direct lines of contact between the two powers devolved into a muddle of nuclear threats, insults and ultimatums. By August, Trump began to impose steep tariffs on any country that buys Russian oil, and he pledged to increase the economic pain until Moscow accepts a ceasefire in Ukraine. Putin refused. His military was ready to advance “across the entire front,” he said, until they achieve victory for Russia.All the while, Lukashenko continued to deliver a very different message to the Americans: Putin wants peace, the dictator assured them, and he is ready to make concessions. These signals nurtured hopes within the White House that a diplomatic breakthrough would soon be possible, and they helped prepare the ground for the U.S. and Russia to announce on Aug. 6 that their leaders would soon meet in person.The war’s conclusion after more than three and a half years may now rest with the world’s two nuclear superpowers. Preparations for the talks are now underway, and they will offer a fresh chance to call a ceasefire. They could also give Putin a chance to prolong the war, as he has in recent months, by dragging out talks and buying the Russian military time to continue the conquest of Ukrainian land and the murder of its people. Having served his function as the go-between, Lukashenko seems ready to step aside. But his role in setting the stage for the summit reveals a lot about the perils of Trump’s latest diplomatic gambit. As Lukashenko explained when we finally met in Minsk, the whole thing could fall apart unless Trump behaves toward Putin with sufficient deference. “You’ve got to make it look good,” he told me. “In the name of peace, maybe you’ve got to be a little cunning and make some concessions. Even if you can’t make sense of Putin, treat him like a human being.” The story of the backchannel through Belarus, in other words, could become the preamble to Ukraine’s capitulation.For an American traveler, the road to Belarus can be a pain. Sanctions from the U.S. and Europe have sealed the country off so tightly that Western airlines no longer fly there. The most direct route requires a flight to Lithuania, at the eastern edge of the NATO alliance, and then a long drive across that heavily guarded frontier into Belarus. Along the way, a traffic sign over the highway in Lithuania offers a warning to anyone heading east: “Minsk,” it says, “Occupied by the Kremlin.”The first U.S. envoy to make this trip on behalf of the Trump administration was Christopher Smith, the State Department’s deputy assistant secretary for Eastern Europe, who has overseen U.S. policy toward Belarus, Ukraine and other parts of the region since the summer of 2023. A career diplomat and fluent Russian speaker, Smith had never met with Lukashenko before his visit to Minsk early this year. Under the Biden Administration, he had implemented a U.S. policy toward Belarus that was often referred to as “maximum pressure.” It used sanctions to isolate Lukashenko’s economy and to punish him for siding with Russia in the war. By imposing such costs, the strategy sought to make him reconsider his alliance with Moscow. It appeared to have the opposite effect. Cut off from commerce with the West, Belarus became ever more dependent on trade with Russia and, to a lesser extent, with China. The low point in Lukashenko’s standoff with the West came in the spring of 2023, when he asked the Kremlin to station nuclear missiles on the territory of Belarus. “I told my big brother, my friend,” Lukashenko recalls of that moment: “We need to return nuclear weapons to Belarus.” Putin obliged. By the end of last year, Smith and his colleagues at the State Department began preparing for a major shift in U.S. policy. Trump had promised during his campaign to improve relations with Putin and quickly end the war in Ukraine. Smith wanted to see how Belarus could help advance both objectives, and he reached out to Minsk through its mission to the United Nations in New York. Lukashenko seized the opportunity. “It’s my credo, a principle of mine,” Lukashenko says. “You’ve got to talk to everybody if you want normal relations, and if you don’t talk, then little by little you’re moving toward war.” In order to draw in the Americans, Lukashenko made an opening gesture of good faith on January 26. He released an American woman, Anastassia Nuhfer, who had been held prisoner in Belarus for nearly five years. Smith negotiated her release in Washington with the Belarusian ambassador to the U.N., Valentin Rybakov. The State Department then arranged for a team from the U.S. embassy in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, to pick Nuhfer up at the border with Belarus and bring her back to the United States. The diplomatic victory, however modest, came in the first week of Trump’s second term, when the incoming administration was eager to find any signs of the winning streak he had promised the American people. Marco Rubio, then five days into his tenure as Secretary of State, ascribed the release of the prisoner to Trump’s leadership and, in a tweet, thanked Smith for facilitating it. In all caps, Rubio added, “PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH.”About two weeks later, on February 12, Smith became the first senior official from the Trump administration to visit Minsk. Lukashenko greeted him at his palace near the city center, a gargantuan pile of marble and gold festooned with pictures from the life of the dictator: snapshots of his childhood and his days as the director of a Soviet collective farm, alongside portraits of him with world leaders like Bill Clinton, Vladimir Putin, Fidel Castro and Volodymyr Zelensky. Over those first several hours of talks, the dictator laid down some ground rules for the resumption of the dialogue between the U.S. and Belarus. Referring to Smith, only half in jest, as an agent of the CIA, Lukashenko urged him never to try driving a wedge between Minsk and Moscow, because he would be wasting both of their time. “If you want to recruit me as your spy, don’t do it. It won’t work,” he recalls telling Smith. “They laughed about it for a long time, the Americans, their delegation. They said, ‘No, no, no. We don’t recruit presidents.’” The second ground rule followed from the first. Lukashenko made clear that he would be coordinating with Putin at every step, and he would not make any decisions without the Kremlin’s approval. “We can talk about Russia, about Putin, about the war and so on, but fundamentally we do not make agreements with the Americans behind Russia’s back,” he says. “That’s a taboo.” The Americans agreed, and a couple of months later, Lukashenko got another visit from a U.S. delegation. It was led by Coale, Trump’s former lawyer and a fixture of the Washington political scene; Coale has been married for 46 years to the news anchor Greta Van Susteren, formerly of Fox News. In 2021, soon after the insurrection at the Capitol, Trump hired Coale to file a class-action lawsuit against Facebook and other social media companies for their decisions to ban Trump from their platforms. The litigation has worked out well for Trump. Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, agreed in January to pay $25 million in a settlement. During his visit to Minsk in April, Coale was treated to a long and extravagant lunch at the presidential palace, featuring potato pancakes with sour cream and other national specialties. Lukashenko, a professed teetotaler, raised a toast of vodka and urged his American guest to drink. That night, he sent Coale home with several more political prisoners, including another American citizen. Once again, Rubio celebrated the release on social media: “No president has done so much, so quickly, to keep Americans safe abroad.” At the U.S. embassy in Vilnius, Coale appeared in a video with the released American, Youras Ziankovich, who wore an American flag draped over his shoulders and thanked Trump for winning his freedom. “It’s baby steps,” Coale told me afterward. “We’re just trying to calm everybody down and keep communicating. That’s a Trump thing. He’ll communicate with anybody. And the more you communicate, the better it gets.”Kremlinologists have often observed Putin’s habit of being late, as though his disdain for the people he meets can be measured by the amount of time he keeps them waiting. (Queen Elizabeth: about 15 minutes; Pope Francis: nearly an hour; U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry: three hours.) Lukashenko, by contrast, arrived a bit early to our interview, and he seemed somewhat nervous as he walked through the door, perspiring around the forehead and wringing his hands. He extended the right one for me to shake, then let me in on a little secret. His intelligence service had prepared a file about me, and he had studied it before our interview. This was one of Lukashenko’s favorite methods of breaking the ice; he said the same thing to Smith when they first met in February. The room set aside for our interview was a small library on the second floor of the palace, where his press team had set up spotlights to film our encounter. Otherwise, the space was dark. On a bookshelf stood the collected works of Alexander Dugin, the Russian imperialist thinker who is credited with building the ideological basis for the invasion of Ukraine. In another corner of the room, behind the bank of cameras, a large painting of Vladimir Lenin stood on an easel, and Lukashenko turned to it as we sat down. It had graced the wall of his office back in the 1980s, he explained, when he served as a Communist Party functionary. In 1994, three years after the Soviet Union fell apart, he won the first presidential election ever held in Belarus—and the last one ever deemed free and fair by international observers. The ethos of his rule since then has been a kind of Soviet revivalism. The country still uses a lot of Soviet emblems and iconography. Its state security service is still known as the KGB, whose headquarters stands across from Dzerzhinsky Square, named after the sociopathic founder of the Soviet secret police.“These days, of course, I’m far from being Soviet, but Soviet principles, the best ones, live inside me,” Lukashenko mused. “Why should I reject them? Just like the Americans do not reject their history, it’s the same with me. That’s why we have this friendship with Russia, the closest kind of cooperation.” The contrast could not have been starker with the path Ukraine had chosen after the fall of the Soviet Union. For at least two decades, it has tried to break with its Soviet past, release itself from Russia’s grip and chart the course of a European democracy. That path had led Putin to order the invasion of Ukraine, killing hundreds of thousands of its citizens and occupying about a fifth of its territory. But Lukashenko, perversely enough, put the blame on the Ukrainians for starting the war. “Zelensky understood that he lives next to Russia, this sleeping bear,” he said. “Why did he go and wake it up?” In his talks with the Americans, Lukashenko has pushed a similar line, arguing that Ukraine was at fault for causing all of the tensions between the U.S. and Russia. It would only be fair, he argued, for the peace talks between Trump and Putin to leave Zelensky on the sidelines, at least in their opening stage. “Putin wants to make a deal with you first and foremost,” Lukashenko said, habitually treating me as a stand-in for the United States. “Come to an agreement on the first day, and then invite Zelensky. That would look dignified.” He felt the same way about the Europeans. “The question is with you, with America,” he told me. “Western Europe can get lost. Putin can disregard them. In this situation, if we reach a deal with the Americans, the Europeans won’t have any way out of it.” He raised the point again later in our interview. “Trump is right,” he said, “to make Europe bow.”On this point, at least, Lukashenko’s position did not seem all that far from that of the White House. Trump’s special envoy to the peace talks in Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, has also argued that the Europeans should not have a seat at the table when the U.S. and Russia meet to agree an end to the war in Ukraine. At a gathering of diplomats and military officers from across the continent in February, he said there would be three parties to the peace talks: Russia and Ukraine, with the U.S. playing the role of a mediator. American diplomats would “take into consideration” the interests of the Europeans in these talks, Kellogg told them, but they would not allow any other parties to complicate the peace process. “What we don’t want to do is get into a large group discussion,” he said. “We are trying to end this in a short period of time.”The highpoint of Lukashenko’s outreach to the White House took place on June 20, when Kellogg led another delegation to Minsk. The retired U.S. Army general brought along his colleagues, Coale and Smith, who had already made the same journey. Unlike their earlier meetings with Lukashenko, this one appeared on state TV in Belarus, where the anchors touted it as a major diplomatic breakthrough. The tone seemed cordial enough. “With all the gold here,” Kellogg said as they sat down in Lukashenko’s office, “this looks a lot like Mar-a-Lago.” But, once the cameras were off, the tone abruptly shifted, and Lukashenko castigated Coale, who was seated directly to his right, for not doing more to influence Trump’s views about Ukraine and Russia.“You drink coffee with him,” Lukashenko boomed. “You’re the one who can set him straight!” According to one person familiar with their meeting, Kellogg also took a harder line than Lukashenko had come to expect from the Americans: “He basically said there’s no trust,” and Belarus needs to “do something very big” to demonstrate its good intentions.Lukashenko did not disappoint. On their way out of Belarus, the American convoy stopped on a village road to rendezvous with a van driven by the KGB. In the back sat 14 prisoners, including one of the regime’s most valuable: Sergei Tikhanovsky, the opposition leader who had tried to run against Lukashenko in the presidential elections of 2020 and was imprisoned two days into his campaign. As the door of the van swung open, Coale says he was shocked to find the prisoners manacled and blindfolded, sitting with their heads between their knees. He recalls yelling at them: “You’re free! President Trump sent me to get you home!” As the talks progressed throughout the spring, Lukashenko stayed in constant touch with Putin, passing along the latest requests and messages from the Americans. “I always did it faithfully,” he recalls. “They would sometimes ask me: Could you pass along this and that? And I would have a call with him every two or three days, sometimes the next day, and I would tell him.” At the time, Trump was growing increasingly frustrated with Putin’s refusal to accept a ceasefire in Ukraine. His envoy to Russia, Steve Witkoff, visited Putin in March and, upon his return, publicly echoed many of Russia’s arguments about the war. He even suggested that the U.S. should allow Russia to keep all the land it has occupied. “The Russians are de facto in control of these territories,” Witkoff said in an interview with Tucker Carlson. “The question is: Will the world acknowledge that those are Russian territories?” After their meeting in Moscow, he added, “I don’t regard Putin as a bad guy.” But Putin still refused to accept any of Trump’s offers of a ceasefire. Instead, Russian missiles and drones continued to target civilians across Ukraine, killing hundreds of people in their homes as they slept, including scores of women and children. “Not necessary, and very bad timing,” Trump wrote on social media after a particularly deadly wave of attacks against Kyiv in April. “Vladimir, STOP!” A few weeks later, Trump and many European leaders urged Putin to come to Istanbul, where Zelensky was waiting to meet him. It would have been their first direct talks since the start of the full-scale invasion.As he considered whether or not to attend, Putin sought the advice of his closest ally, and Lukashenko urged him to stay away. “I told him, there’s nothing for you to do there,” he recalls. “It looked like a bunch of posturing,” as though Zelensky were taunting Putin in Istanbul, daring him to show up for a duel at high noon. “That’s not how it’s done in politics,” Lukashenko says. The tone and format of the negotiations, at least in their initial phase, matter as much to the Russians as their substance, Lukashenko suggested. “You’ve got to do it carefully,” he told me. “Don’t dictate terms. Don’t bang your fist. Don’t insult Putin. Russia will not forgive him if he swallows such an insult.” Trump needs to understand, he continued, that Putin can tell him to “go to hell” if he feels disrespected. “He hasn’t done that yet,” Lukashenko said, “but he can do it.” The Americans, in other words, should be as concerned about protecting Putin’s fragile ego, his sense of pride and his approval ratings, as they are about protecting Ukrainian lives and territory.Throughout the spring and summer, Lukashenko passed the same message to the Americans: “Putin is ready for peace negotiations. Just treat him with respect.” He repeated the same thing several times during the three hours we spent together. “Believe me,” Lukashenko said, “Putin wants peace. He really wants it.” Yet there has been nothing in Putin’s behavior to substantiate such a claim. Based on his actions, the opposite seemed to be true. Starting in the spring, Russia ramped up the intensity of its air raids against Ukraine, which reached a monthly record in July of 6,443 missiles and drones. In the east of Ukraine, Russian forces meanwhile continued to make plodding but significant advances, while the authorities in Kyiv grew more eager for a ceasefire, as did their constituents. The latest Gallup poll, published on Aug. 7, found that support among Ukrainians for continuing to fight until victory has hit a new low. More than two thirds now favor a negotiated end to the war as soon as possible. About a week after our interview in Minsk, Trump sent Witkoff to Moscow for another round of talks with Putin. This time, the envoy appeared to make progress. Putin handed him a set of demands for ending the war in Ukraine, and the two sides agreed to hold a presidential summit to discuss it as soon as possible. The intended format of the talks matched up with Lukashenko’s vision. According to the Kremlin, they would like to begin with a meeting between Trump and Putin, one on one. “We propose, first of all, to focus on preparing a bilateral meeting,” said Putin’s foreign policy adviser, Yuri Ushakov.That arrangement looked humiliating for the Ukrainians. A pillar of their foreign policy has long been the maxim: “Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.” Now, if the meeting between Putin and Trump goes ahead, Ukraine’s future could be decided over its head, without the participation of its leaders, who would be forced to acknowledge, at least implicitly, that the freedom and sovereignty for which their nation has been fighting must be subordinated to the will of larger powers. Lukashenko does not see that as much of a problem. In his view, Ukraine already lost its sovereignty when it became dependent during the war on financial and military aid from the U.S. and Europe. If it’s not careful, he adds, it could lose Kyiv the same way it lost its eastern regions. “It has already lost control of its territories. As of today, it has lost them.” He admitted, however, that Russia may not be in a position to seize much more. “Putin understands what that would cost,” Lukashenko says. “The price of that victory would be high.” Despite all his bluster, he seemed to acknowledge that Russia’s position has also grown precarious in recent months. Its revenues from the sale of oil and gas, the lifeblood of its economy, collapsed by 28% in July. This marked the third consecutive month of declines as global oil prices have fallen. Since the start of the war, Russia has spent around 70% of its national rainy day fund, leaving it vulnerable to economic shocks. “It seems to me that this war, this special military operation, has not gone the way he thought,” Lukashenko says. Does that mean Putin looks back on it all with regret? “Yes, I think so. I’m sure that he regrets a lot of things, a lot.” And what concessions would he make to bring the war to an end? What would prevent Putin from starting another war once he has time to reconstitute his armies and rebuild his economy? Here Lukashenko grew more circumspect, as though such questions were not consequential enough to delay the peace process. For a start, he suggested, the Americans should formally recognize Russia’s claim to four regions of southern and eastern Ukraine, even though Russian forces are still far from conquering all of these regions. Trump should, in other words, do what his envoy Steve Witkoff seemed open to doing after his visit with Putin this spring. Such a move from the Americans, Lukashenko told me, would “probably” satisfy Putin’s imperial ambitions, and prevent him from trying to seize any more of Ukraine. Probably. That was as much as he could promise. Lukashenko’s role, as he saw it, was to find a way for Trump and Putin to get together and end the war. The details would be for them to figure out. “Everything now is in Donald’s hands,” he told me. “And he can screw it all up because of that character of his.” All the deadlines and ultimatums that Trump had set for the peace deal, all the threats of tariffs and sanctions against Russia, “It’s foolish. It’s all pure emotions,” Lukashenko continued. “And in politics, that’s not allowed.”As we stood to say goodbye, the dictator finally explained why he had been so eager to speak with me. His effort with Putin to arrange a peace on favorable terms for the Russians had made so much headway with the Americans. It helped win so much extra time for the Russian military to continue its summer offensive in Ukraine. But now, at the crucial moment, Trump had begun to take a harder line, threatening to impose tariffs on any country that buys Russian oil, starting with India and moving on to China and Turkey. “I hope you will shake up public opinion in the United States of America,” Lukashenko told me. “It’ll all work out. Just give Trump a push.” As it turned out, Trump did not need any prompting from the public to proceed toward a summit with Putin. He may not have needed any advice from Belarus either. No matter how much Lukashenko may have wanted to seem like an honest broker, the sum of his messaging to all of Trump’s envoys, and to me, amounted to a lot of hype about the dangers of playing tough with Putin. He wanted us all to believe that the U.S., in dealing with the Kremlin, should adopt a tone of deference. But Trump already tried that at the start of this year. It did not bring Ukraine any closer to peace.",

        "content": "Opinion editor’s note: Strib Voices publishes a mix of commentary online and in print each day. To contribute, click here . ••• Cheers to state Rep. Kaohly Vang Her ... for entering the mayoral race in St. Paul against fellow DFLer Mayor Melvin Carter. August seems a bit late to step up for a November contest, but better late than never as Carter was set to cruise to a third term even though St. Paul is going through a tough stretch and the city could benefit from serious conversations about the steep property taxes and the future of downtown. Her’s a veteran legislator who should be able to push those discussions forward. Also, St. Paul’s long overdue to elect a female mayor. Jeers to state Sen. Omar Fateh ... a democratic socialist and the DFL-endorsed candidate for mayor in Minneapolis, for receiving two tickets in the past year for violating the state’s hands-free cellphone law while driving a black 2023 BMW X3, according to district court records. At the first stop on Aug. 12 near Mankato, Fateh told the officer he was holding his phone to punch in his GPS coordinates. At the second stop in January, Fateh again told a Golden Valley police officer he was holding the phone to look at his GPS. The officer didn’t buy it, writing on the citation that Fateh had the GPS up on the vehicle’s navigation screen, had previously been cited for the same offense and “knew he wasn’t supposed to have a cellphone in hand.” Fateh paid $135 for the first offense and $158 for the second. Once is a mistake. Twice is a habit. Fateh needs to take a break and pull over before using his phone; texting while driving is extremely dangerous. Cheers to Colin and Sophie Hortman ... the surviving adult children of the late House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, for sharing their parents’ love of music on the Current , 89.3 in the Twin Cities. Colin said Led Zeppelin was Mark Hortman’s favorite. Sophie Hortman talked about her mom driving the blue minivan belting with Prince on “Raspberry Beret” and cleaning her D.C. apartment to “Situation” by Yaz. The two siblings recalled their parents dancing to Van Morrison’s “Moondance.” When Sophie turned 17, she and her mom cranked “Dancing Queen” by ABBA. A big cheers and virtual hugs to Sophie and Colin for gracefully sharing themselves, just as they did in June with the indelible list of ways to honor their parents , and helping us through our collective grief. Jeers to the season of politicians chasing clout ... and votes by circling around the state’s most popular sports team, the Minnesota Vikings. There was Sen. Amy Klobuchar wearing Vikings-branded sneakers while cozying up to Coach Kevin O’Connell in Eagan. “Nothing like Vikings training camp for high hopes! Caught up with the incredible Coach Kevin O’Connell to talk everything Vikings!” Whew. If exclamation marks were pompoms, she could join the Vikings’ cheer team. U.S. Rep. Angie Craig was at camp earlier in the week along with state DFL Sens. Matt Klein, of Mendota Heights, and Nick Frentz, of Mankato. Craig also stopped by a Minnesota Lynx game but kept her Vikings cap on during a FarmFest forum Tuesday where she saluted the optimism of U.S. Rep. Pete Stauber’s decision to wear a Minnesota Twins cap at the same panel. If attending sporting events and camps gets politicians out and talking to the voters, then so much the better. Now, if only the Republicans in Congress would host town halls. Cheers to those willing to change their minds Sen. Amy Klobuchar last week voted for the first time to block U.S. arms sales to Israel, citing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. “I’ve supported military assistance to Israel in the past, and I have made it clear that I believe Israel has a right to defend itself,” Klobuchar said in a statement. “But I believe at this moment in time it’s crucial that the Israeli government must do more to alleviate the urgent humanitarian crisis.” On a much lighter note and also representing a laudable change of mind, cheers to Brooks Cullen of the famed Moorhead hockey family for switching his commitment from Michigan State to the Gophers , meaning he will play alongside his newly committed brother Wyatt at Mariucci Arena, and we can’t wait. Jeers, and long overdue ones at that ... to U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis., who represents the Driftless Area across the border. Van Orden can be a magnetic presence and gripping speaker on the campaign trail, but his feud with fellow Wisconsin U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, a Democrat, sunk lower than ever this week . Van Orden started by posting a photo of a man wearing nothing but a balaclava and clogs, falsely claiming it was Pocan on a European vacation. Pocan responded by calling Van Orden, “KKKlassy.” The long-running spat devolved from there and as Minnesotans, we can be smug and most grateful that feuds among our politicians haven’t devolved into naked photos — yet. Cheers to Sen. Ron Latz, DFL-St. Louis Park ... for taking less than 24 hours after a state Supreme Court ruling to promise a new bill to close a loophole in the law regarding ghost guns, which are privately assembled through kits or parts. The court’s ruling said it’s legal for Minnesotans to possess ghost guns without a serial number. Latz promised a bill next session to align state law with federal law and require serial numbers on homemade guns. “No one could’ve foreseen a world where you could print the parts to make a gun at home, but that’s the world we live in today,” Latz said. Cheers as well to Chief Justice Natalie Hudson and Justice Karl Procaccini for dissenting from the majority’s decision.",

Despite the late entry—August typically marks too close to the November deadline—the decision comes amid concerns over St. Paul's economic challenges, including soaring property taxes and uncertainty regarding its urban core development. As a seasoned legislator, Vang Her brings experience that could prove instrumental in steering these critical issues onto the city's agenda. Additionally, her candidacy represents a much-needed opportunity for women to lead in St. Paul's political landscape.\nMeanwhile, controversy surrounds state Senator Omar Fateh, the endorsed DFL candidate for Minneapolis mayor, following reports of him accumulating two speeding tickets within a single year due to infractions related to the state's hands-free cellphone laws. On August 12th near Mankato, Fateh explained to an officer that he needed to use his phone to input GPS coordinates during a traffic stop. In another incident earlier in January, Fateh claimed similar reasons when confronted by a Golden Valley police officer. However, officers noted that Fateh had already received citations under comparable circumstances and were skeptical of his explanations. He settled both fines amounting to $293—a pattern suggesting repeated disregard for safe driving practices.\nOn a lighter note, Colin and Sophie Hortman, offspring of former House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her spouse Mark, recently shared personal anecdotes celebrating their family's passion for music on the Current FM station in the Twin Cities. They reminisced about their mother's fondness for bands like Led Zeppelin and Prince, along with cherished moments such as listening to 'Raspberry Beret' while cruising in a blue minivan or enjoying 'Dancing Queen' together upon Sophie's 17th birthday.\nThe Minnesota Vikings also made headlines locally, although details specific to their story remain unmentioned.",

Despite expressing caution, Zelensky maintained an air of optimism throughout these developments, underscoring the importance of collective European efforts alongside Poland in steering toward a comprehensive resolution.\nAdding another layer to the complex geopolitical landscape, former British Defense Secretary Sir Ben Wallace advocated for Britain's or France's participation—given their status as nuclear-capable EU members—in the upcoming trilateral discussion. His stance reflects concerns over ensuring that Ukraine does not succumb to unfavorable terms under duress—a situation reminiscent of historical precedents where smaller states faced coercion from larger powers.\nAmidst these unfolding events, President Zelensky took to social media to reaffirm solidarity with Poland and express gratitude for allied support. He emphasized the necessity of robust security frameworks for Ukraine and reiterated his commitment to working collaboratively with European partners like Poland to secure enduring peace.\nAs tensions simmered across the globe, Trump's previous assertions made during his presidential campaign—that he possessed the capability to resolve the Ukraine conflict swiftly upon assuming office—remained unfulfilled.

        "description": "To stay ahead, Singapore must remain \"exceptional\" in its cohesion, resolve and performance, as well as \"move faster, adapt quicker and innovate smarter\", says Prime Minister Lawrence Wong.",
        "content": "SINGAPORE: Singapore is refreshing its economic strategy to secure its future in a “very different world” marked by greater contestation, fragmentation and volatility, said Prime Minister Lawrence Wong on Friday (Aug 8). To stay ahead, the country must remain \"exceptional\" in its cohesion, resolve and performance, as well as “move faster, adapt quicker and innovate smarter”, he said in his National Day Message that is broadcast every year on the eve of the nation's birthday. This means embracing new technologies such as artificial intelligence and robotics , while applying them meaningfully across its economy. “We must enable our people, workers and businesses to make full use of these tools, and sharpen our competitive edge,” said Mr Wong, who is also Finance Minister. Amid disruption and the rapid pace of change, not everyone will find the transition easy, he added. To this, Mr Wong pledged that the government “will walk this journey” with Singaporeans as it has done for the past six decades. “We will expand opportunities for learning and skills upgrading, strengthen social safety nets, and help every Singaporean who faces setbacks to bounce back and press on,” he said. “That is why I launched Forward Singapore – to refresh our social compact and give every Singaporean the support and confidence to travel the road ahead.” The government has also introduced new policies, like the SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support Scheme, to help those who lose their jobs get back on their feet. “We will do more to uplift lower-income workers and families, and create more pathways for every Singaporean to succeed, regardless of their starting point in life,” said Mr Wong. Earlier this week, the government announced a fresh review of the country’s economic strategy . Five committees, which report to the Singapore Economic Resilience Taskforce headed by Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong, have been formed to develop longer-term strategies in areas such as sharpening the country’s global competitiveness and ability to tap on new technologies. The committees are expected to publish a report outlining their recommendations by mid-2026. FORK IN THE ROAD In his message which was recorded at the Padang, Mr Wong spoke about how Singapore now stands at a \"fork in the road\". \"To put it bluntly, the global order that enabled Singapore to thrive for decades is unraveling before our eyes,\" said the prime minister, reiterating that the country must now navigate a more contested, fragmented and volatile world. Thus far, Singapore’s economy remains resilient but the outlook ahead continues to be “ highly uncertain ”, said Mr Wong. “We expect the global economy to remain troubled for some time. Businesses everywhere are holding back on expansion and new investments,” he said. Apart from tackling immediate headwinds, Singapore will also have to look ahead by anticipating what is on the horizon and preparing to ride the next wave of change, he added. Mr Wong noted that other countries armed with more resources and larger populations “are not standing still”. The bigger powers are also “now more willing to use every tool at their disposal – economic, technological and geopolitical – to tilt the playing field in their favour”, making it harder for small states like Singapore to hold its own. “Difficult times lie ahead but we are not going to throw up our hands in despair. We will overcome our new challenges,” said the prime minister. He added that Singaporeans have made a “considered and clear choice” in the recent General Election. Said Mr Wong: “You chose the team you believe can best steer Singapore through this turbulence. Your wisdom and trust give my government the political assurance to act boldly, and the confidence to lead with conviction, and that is exactly what we are doing.” The People’s Action Party (PAP) had won 87 out of 97 seats – or almost 90 per cent of the seats – in the May 3 polls, staving off challenges from the opposition without conceding any new ground to its rivals. The polls marked Prime Minister Lawrence Wong's first electoral test leading the ruling party. In leading the PAP to an increased vote share, Mr Wong bucked a trend: Previous elections in 1991 and 2006 saw dips in the PAP's vote share after a new prime minister took office. THE SINGAPORE SPIRIT Recalling Singapore’s independence in 1965 – one that was forced by circumstances and required the country to summon its resolve and will to survive, Mr Wong said: “At many points, history could have easily taken a darker turn. Yet against all odds, we made it. “This is what makes SG60 so significant – not just that we endured, but that we prevailed and prospered when few believed we would even survive.” Through challenges ranging from racial strife to the pullout of British forces, economic crises to global pandemics, Singapore and Singaporeans “picked ourselves up, learnt from our setbacks, and found the strength and will to carry on”. At the heart lies the “Singapore spirit”, which represents a deep sense of solidarity and shared purpose, he said. “As a small nation, we cannot afford to be divided. Our unity has always been our source of strength. When we stand together, there is nothing we cannot overcome,” said Mr Wong. The prime minister noted that Singapore has gone from a third-world to a first-world nation in 60 years “not through luck, but through sheer determination, resilience and unity”. As the country stands on the threshold of a new chapter, it must draw strength from its past and press forward with confidence. “Together, we will secure a brighter future for ourselves, our children, and generations to come,” he said. “Happy National Day. Majulah Singapura!”",

        "ai_content": "In a pivotal address marking Singapore's National Day, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong outlined a refreshed approach to fortify the nation against the backdrop of a rapidly evolving international arena characterized by increased competition, division, and unpredictability. Emphasizing the necessity for Singapore to uphold its reputation for being 'exceptional'—a testament to its unity, determination, and excellence—Wong called upon the country to accelerate progress, swiftly adjust to changes, and enhance ingenuity.\nThe Prime Minister underscored the importance of integrating cutting-edge technologies into various sectors, including artificial intelligence and robotics, ensuring they serve practical purposes within the national economy. 'We must empower our workforce and enterprises to leverage these advancements,' stated Wong, concurrently holding dual roles as Prime Minister and Finance Minister.\nAcknowledging the potential difficulties faced by individuals amid swift transformations, Wong committed the government's unwavering support—a tradition spanning over sixty years—to assist Singaporeans throughout this period of adjustment. Initiatives such as expanding educational resources, reinforcing social security frameworks, and assisting those encountering obstacles were highlighted as part of this pledge.\nA significant component of Wong's vision includes launching Forward Singapore, designed to rejuvenate societal agreements and instill confidence among citizens about navigating forthcoming challenges. Complementing this initiative, recent policy introductions include measures like the SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support Scheme, aiming to facilitate reintegration into employment following job displacement.\nFurther bolstering efforts to elevate economically disadvantaged groups and creating diverse success avenues irrespective of initial circumstances forms another cornerstone of Wong's agenda. A comprehensive evaluation of Singapore's economic blueprint commenced earlier this month, involving five specialized committees under the guidance of Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong. These bodies focus on enhancing global market competitiveness and harnessing novel technological prospects.\nAnticipated outcomes from these committees involve detailed reports due by mid-2026, presenting strategic insights poised to shape Singapore's long-term trajectory.",

        "content": "A family have left the \"hostile\" US as they didn't want to raise their children in Trump's America. Rachel, 29, and her husband, Ethan Edwards, 33, have always thought about travelling, but after the birth of their four children, aged seven, five, four, and 10 months, they got \"sidetracked\". She said the re-election of Donald Trump and the current cost-of-living crisis made them take this leap, as they didn't feel that life would get better for them in the US. READ MORE: Conor McGregor invites Donald Trump to Ireland and drops wild AI image READ MORE: Deformed inbred children of chilling incest cult unable to speak or see The couple sold all their belongings, including their four-bedroom home and are living out of 10 suitcases - leaving the states on July 7, 2025. They are currently living in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, until September, when they plan to visit Thailand - intending to get residency in a different country. Rachel said she is fearful of the future for the USA , and said she wanted her children to see the world and explore different cultures. Rachel, a mortgage and loan officer, from Tulsa, Oklahoma, said: \"Where we were living has become so hostile, everything is divided. If you are walking around with a red hat on, you get people being mean to you; if you have a Kamala ticket on your car you get it keyed. \"You are targeted on your beliefs, everyone is so stressed out because we are all living through the same crisis. Everyone is suffering from the cost of living.\" Rachel and Ethan have always dreamed of traveling, but after the birth of their four children, they admit that life got in the way. She said that the cost of living crisis, mixed with the current political climate in the U.S. confirmed their decision to leave. On March, 2025, they decided to leave the USA and by May, they had put their house on the market and sold all their belongings. On July 7, 2025, the couple flew from San Francisco International Airport on a one-way ticket to Malaysia. Rachel said: \"There have definitely been some recent political events that led us to feel there was no better time to leave than now. \"We wanted to live a life worth living. The biggest catalyst was the cost-of-living crisis in America. We felt like we were working ourselves to death and having nothing to show for it. We were afraid we were one problem away from going bankrupt, or not being able to pay for the house - it was terrifying.\" In the US, Rachel said they were paying $3k (€2,578) a month on basic house costs - including mortgage and household bills - compared to the $700 (€601) they are currently paying. Back home, Rachel said the couple was paying $650 (€558) a month for health insurance, compared to $200 (€172) for international health insurance. Rachel said it was a \"no-brainer\" to leave the US, and they are enjoying every moment. She said: \"The biggest difference we have realized is the housing crisis, with property taxes and insurance we were paying $800 a month more than we did originally. \"We were spending $3k a month on basis housing costs. We were able to pay our bills, we had minimal debt, and not in that bad of a spot. But it was one of those situations, where after everything was paid, we didn't have much money left - we weren't saving a thing.\" Rachel said that the current political climate in America was a worry for her and Ethan. She said she didn't want to raise children who thought they were better than everyone because they are white. According to The Guardian, the state's new social studies curriculum will ask high school students to identify \"discrepencies\" in the 2020 election. Rachel said: \"Oklahoma schools to teach pupils that the 2020 election was stolen and Trump won. I don't say this lightly, but we did not want to raise white supremacists; we wanted our children to see the world. \"We didn't want them to think that just because they are born with that privilege, they are better than everyone else. People think because they are white, they are entitled to everything and other people are entitled to nothing - I did not want that for my children.\" The family are currently living in the nation's capital - Kuala Lumpur - and plan to visit Thailand before finding a place where they will seek residency. Rachel said: \"We have loved every minute of being here, we feel comfortable raising our kids here. We are on a tourist visa for now, but we would eventually like to settle somewhere to raise our kids long term and get integrated into the community. \"The plan is to start applying for schools to get my master's degree so then we can apply for a longer-term visa. The end goal is to apply for residency somewhere.\" For the latest breaking news and top stories from the Irish Mirror, visit our homepage",

        "ai_content": "In a bold move reflecting deep concern for their children's upbringing amidst what they describe as 'hostile' conditions under President Donald Trump's administration, Rachel and Ethan Edwards have departed the United States. The couple, who once dreamt of globetrotting post-parenthood, found themselves compelled to prioritize stability during America's ongoing economic turmoil. With four children at various stages—seven, five, four, and ten months old—their journey began with selling off assets, culminating in a sale of their four-bedroom home. By mid-July 2025, they relocated to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where they will stay until early September before heading to Thailand with aspirations of securing long-term residency abroad.\nThe Edwards' decision came amid escalating tensions following Trump's reelection bid—a sentiment echoed across social media platforms—and exacerbated by the nation's spiraling cost-of-living crisis. Rachel, a mortgage and loan officer originally from Tulsa, Oklahoma, expressed fear for the country's trajectory and emphasized the importance of exposing their children to diverse cultures beyond American borders. 'Our former community became increasingly divisive,' Rachel stated. 'It seemed every day brought new challenges based on one's appearance or affiliations.'\nTheir story unfolds against a backdrop of widespread discontent among Americans grappling with financial strain. Despite previously setting aside dreams of international exploration while raising their kids domestically, the Edwards chose to confront these ambitions head-on. As they prepare to settle into Thai society permanently, questions linger regarding how many other families might find similar solace outside the United States.",

Sky News has learnt that Carlyle, which is the biggest lender to Very Group's immediate parent company, could assume ownership of the retailer as soon as October under the terms of its financing arrangements.

        "content": "The American investment giant Carlyle is preparing to take control of Very Group, one of Britain's biggest online retailers, in a deal that will end the Barclay family's long tenure at another major UK company. Sky News has learnt that Carlyle, which is the biggest lender to Very Group's immediate parent company, could assume ownership of the retailer as soon as October under the terms of its financing arrangements. On Friday, sources said that Carlyle was expected to hold further talks in the coming weeks with fellow creditors including IMI, the Abu Dhabi-based vehicle which assumed part of Very Group's debts in a complex deal related to ownership of the Telegraph newspaper titles. Carlyle will probably end up holding a majority stake in Very Group, which has about 4.5 million customers, once it exercises a 'step-in right' which effectively converts its debt into equity ownership, the sources said. Very Group - which is chaired by the former Conservative chancellor Nadhim Zahawi - borrowed a further £600m from Arini, a Mayfair-based fund, earlier this year as it sought to stave off a cash crunch and buy itself breathing space. Precise details of the company's capital and ownership structure will be thrashed out before the change of control rights are triggered at the beginning of October. The Barclay family drew up plans to hire bankers to run an auction of Very Group earlier this year, but a process was never formally launched. Carlyle, which declined to comment, may hold onto the business for a further period before looking to offload it. IMI is also likely to end up with an equity stake or a preferred position in the recapitalised company's debt structure, sources added. Prospective bidders for Very Group were expected to be courted on the basis of its technology-driven financial services arm as well as the core retail offering which sells everything from electrical goods to fashion. Retail industry insiders have long speculated that the business was likely to be valued in the region of £2.5bn - below the valuation which the Barclay family was holding out for in an auction which took place several years ago. Very Group - previously known as Shop Direct - is one of the UK's biggest online shopping businesses, owning the Very and Littlewoods brands and employing 3,700 people. It boasts well over £2bn in annual sales, with about one-fifth of that generated by its Very Finance consumer lending arm. Mr Zahawi was appointed as the company's chairman last year, days after he announced that he was standing down as the MP for Stratford-on-Avon at July's general election. He replaced Aidan Barclay, a senior member of the family which has owned the business for decades. In the 39 weeks to 29 March, Very Group reported a 3.8% fall in revenue to £1.67bn, which it said included \"a decrease in Littlewoods revenue of 15.1%, reflecting the ongoing managed decline of this business\". Nevertheless, it said sales in its home and sports categories were performing strongly. IMI's position is expected to be pivotal to the talks about the future of the business, given Abu Dhabi's status as an important global backer of buyout, credit and infrastructure funds such as those raised and managed by Carlyle. The UAE vehicle is expected to emerge from the protracted saga over the Telegraph's ownership with a 15% stake in the newspapers. Under the original deal struck in 2023, RedBird and IMI paid a total of £1.2bn to refinance the Barclay family's debts to Lloyds Banking Group, with half tied to the media assets and the other half - solely funded by IMI - secured against other family assets including part of Very Group's debt pile. The Barclays, who used to own London's Ritz hotel, have already lost control of other corporate assets including the Yodel parcel delivery service. A spokesman for Very Group declined to comment, while IMI also declined to comment.",

Carlyle, already the largest creditor to Very Group's parent company, might gain full ownership by October following refinancing deals. Talks with other creditors like IMI are ongoing. Very Group currently serves around 4.5 million customers and had recently secured additional funding to avoid financial difficulties.",
        "ai_content": "In a significant shift within the UK's retail sector, Carlyle, America's leading private equity firm, is poised to take over Very Group, one of Britain’s most prominent online shopping platforms. This move marks the conclusion of the Barclay family's longstanding association with a key UK enterprise. According to reports received by Sky News, Carlyle stands ready to assert control over Very Group potentially starting in October, contingent upon their current loan agreements being fulfilled.\nThe transition comes amid discussions between Carlyle and various stakeholders who have extended credit lines to Very Group's parent entity. Among these parties is IMI, an Abu Dhabi-based conglomerate that previously absorbed some of Very Group's liabilities during transactions linked to the acquisition of several Telegraph newspapers.\nVery Group, presently helmed by ex-Conservative Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi, boasts approximately four-and-a-half million loyal patrons. In recent months, the retailer managed to secure an additional £600 million through Arini, a London-based venture capital firm, aiming to alleviate imminent fiscal pressures and create operational leeway.\nWhile initial strategies were formulated last year involving banking professionals conducting an auction for Very Group—a plan ultimately shelved—Carlyle now appears more inclined towards maintaining possession rather than divesting shortly thereafter. Concurrently, there exists speculation regarding IMI possibly acquiring either an equity interest or a preferential claim within the restructured debt framework post-acquisition.\nAs negotiations progress toward finalizing the transaction parameters prior to the activation of Carlyle's takeover prerogatives early next month, industry observers remain watchful for developments concerning potential future buyers.",
