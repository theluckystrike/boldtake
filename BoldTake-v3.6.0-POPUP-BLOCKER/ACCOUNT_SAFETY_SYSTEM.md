# BoldTake Account Safety System v1.0.12

## 🛡️ Overview
Version 1.0.12 introduces critical safety features to protect user accounts from being flagged, shadowbanned, or suspended by X.com's anti-spam algorithms.

## 🚨 Critical Safety Features

### 1. Burst Protection
**Purpose**: Prevents rapid-fire actions that trigger spam detection
- **Limit**: Maximum 3 actions in any 5-minute window
- **Cooldown**: 10-minute mandatory pause if limit reached
- **Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of action timestamps

### 2. Hourly Rate Limiting
**Purpose**: Enforces safe hourly engagement levels
- **Soft Limit**: 12 comments per hour (safe zone)
- **Hard Limit**: 15 comments per hour (emergency stop)
- **Action**: Session automatically stops at hard limit

### 3. Risk Assessment System
**Purpose**: Continuous monitoring of account risk level
- **Risk Levels**: Low, Medium, High, Critical
- **Risk Score**: 0-100 based on multiple factors
- **Emergency Stop**: Automatic at Critical level (80+ score)

### 4. Enhanced Timing
**Purpose**: Natural human-like behavior patterns
- **Minimum Delay**: 2 minutes between actions (was 1 minute)
- **Break Probability**: 25% chance of longer breaks
- **Micro-Breaks**: 30% chance of 4-minute pauses

## 📊 Risk Scoring Algorithm

| Factor | Low Risk | Medium Risk | High Risk |
|--------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Burst Actions (5 min) | 0-1 | 2 | 3+ |
| Hourly Actions | 0-7 | 8-10 | 11+ |
| Failure Rate | <20% | 20-30% | >30% |
| Consecutive Failures | 0 | 1 | 2+ |

### Risk Score Calculation:
- **0-39**: Low Risk (Green) - Normal operation
- **40-59**: Medium Risk (Yellow) - Extra delays added
- **60-79**: High Risk (Orange) - 5-minute safety delays
- **80+**: Critical Risk (Red) - EMERGENCY STOP

## 🔒 Protection Mechanisms

### Double Comment Prevention
- Likes tweets after replying to mark as processed
- Enhanced like verification with retry logic
- Fallback marking for failed likes
- Skip already-liked tweets in selection

### Pattern Detection Avoidance
- Randomized delays (60% variance)
- Variable typing speeds
- Natural reading time simulation
- Unpredictable break patterns

### Emergency Protocols
1. **Burst Detected**: 10-minute cooldown
2. **Hourly Limit**: Session stops
3. **Critical Risk**: Immediate termination
4. **Multiple Failures**: Extended delays

## 📈 Safe Usage Guidelines

### Recommended Settings
```javascript
Daily Target: 80-100 tweets (not 120)
Session Duration: 6-8 hours
Break Frequency: Every 10-15 tweets
Time of Day: Vary start times
```

### Warning Signs
- Risk level above "Low" frequently
- Multiple burst protection triggers
- Hourly limit reached regularly
- High failure rate (>30%)

### Best Practices
1. **Start Slow**: Begin with 50 tweets/day, gradually increase
2. **Take Breaks**: Use manual breaks between sessions
3. **Vary Timing**: Don't run at same time daily
4. **Monitor Risk**: Watch the risk indicator
5. **Quality Over Quantity**: Better fewer good replies

## 🚦 Status Indicators

### Console Messages
- `🟢 Low Risk` - Safe to continue
- `🟡 Medium Risk` - Caution, delays added
- `🟠 High Risk` - Significant delays, consider stopping
- `🔴 Critical Risk` - EMERGENCY STOP

### Activity Feed
- Shows real-time risk level
- Burst protection warnings
- Hourly limit alerts
- Safety delay notifications

## 🛠️ Configuration

### Adjustable Limits (in code)
```javascript
MAX_COMMENTS_PER_DAY: 120     // Daily limit
MAX_COMMENTS_PER_HOUR: 12     // Hourly limit
MAX_BURST_ACTIONS: 3           // 5-minute window
MIN_DELAY_BETWEEN_ACTIONS: 120000  // 2 minutes
```

### Safety Overrides
- Cannot be disabled via UI (intentional)
- Hardcoded for user protection
- Only adjustable by code modification

## 📊 Monitoring & Logs

### What's Tracked
- Action timestamps (recentActions array)
- Hourly activity (hourlyActions array)
- Risk score and level
- Burst protection triggers
- Emergency stops

### Debug Commands
```javascript
// Check current risk
console.log('Risk:', sessionStats.accountRisk, sessionStats.riskScore);

// View recent actions
console.log('Recent:', sessionStats.recentActions);

// Check hourly count
console.log('Hourly:', sessionStats.hourlyActions?.length);
```

## ⚠️ Important Warnings

### Never Do This
- ❌ Remove safety delays
- ❌ Increase burst limits
- ❌ Disable risk assessment
- ❌ Run multiple sessions
- ❌ Ignore risk warnings

### Account Safety Priority
The extension prioritizes account safety over speed. This means:
- Slower processing when risk detected
- Automatic stops to protect account
- Conservative limits by design
- No override options for safety features
